Introduction The T*** Traveller (*** so it w*** be convenient to speak of h*** was expounding a recondite matter to us. His p*** g*** e*** shone and twinkled, and his usually p*** f*** was flushed and animated. The f*** burnt brightly, and the s*** radiance of the incandescent lights in the lilies of silver caught the bubbles t*** flashed and passed in our glasses. Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and caressed us rather t*** submitted to be sat upon, and there was t*** luxurious after-dinner atmosphere, w*** thought r*** gracefully f*** of the trammels of precision. And he put it to us in t*** wayâ\\x80\\x94marking the points w*** a l*** forefingerâ\\x80\\x94as we sat and lazily admired his earnestness o*** t*** new paradox (as we thought it) and his fecundity. â\\x80\\x9cYou m*** follow me carefully. I shall h*** to controvert one or two ideas t*** are almost universally accepted. The geometry, for instance, t*** taught you at school is founded on a misconception.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIs not t*** rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?â\\x80\\x9d s*** Filby, an argumentative person w*** red hair. â*** do not m*** to ask you to accept anything without reasonable ground for it. You w*** s*** admit as m*** as I n*** f*** you. You k*** of course t*** a mathematical line, a l*** of thickness _nil_, has no r*** existence. T*** taught you that? Neither has a mathematical plane. These things are m*** abstractions.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThat is all right,â\\x80\\x9d s*** the Psychologist. â\\x80\\x9cNor, having o*** length, breadth, and thickness, can a c*** h*** a r*** existence.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThere I object,â\\x80\\x9d s*** Filby. â\\x80\\x9cOf course a solid b*** may exist. All r*** thingsâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cSo m*** people think. But w*** a moment. Can an _instantaneous_ c*** exist?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t follow you,â\\x80\\x9d s*** Filby. â\\x80\\x9cCan a c*** t*** d*** not l*** for any t*** at a*** h*** a r*** existence?â\\x80\\x9d Filby became pensive. â\\x80\\x9cClearly,â\\x80\\x9d the T*** Traveller proceeded, â\\x80\\x9cany r*** b*** m*** h*** extension in _four_ directions: it m*** h*** Length, Breadth, Thickness, andâ\\x80\\x94Duration. But through a natural infirmity of the flesh, which I w*** explain to you in a moment, we incline to overlook t*** fact. There are really f*** dimensions, three which we c*** the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time. There is, however, a tendency to d*** an unreal distinction between the former three dimensions and the latter, because it happens t*** our consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter f*** the beginning to the end of our lives.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThat,â\\x80\\x9d s*** a v*** young m*** making spasmodic efforts to relight his cigar o*** the lamp; â\\x80\\x9cthat . . . v*** clear indeed.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNow, it is v*** remarkable t*** t*** is so extensively overlooked,â\\x80\\x9d continued the T*** Traveller, w*** a slight accession of cheerfulness. â\\x80\\x9cReally t*** is w*** is meant by the Fourth Dimension, though s*** people who t*** about the Fourth Dimension do not k*** t*** m*** it. It is o*** another way of looking at Time. _There is no difference between T*** and any of the three dimensions of Space except t*** our consciousness moves along it_. But s*** foolish people h*** got h*** of the wrong s*** of t*** idea. You h*** all heard w*** t*** h*** to say about t*** Fourth Dimension?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c_I_ h*** not,â\\x80\\x9d s*** the Provincial Mayor. â\\x80\\x9cIt is simply this. T*** Space, as our mathematicians h*** it, is spoken of as having three dimensions, which one may c*** Length, Breadth, and Thickness, and is always definable by reference to three planes, e*** at right angles to the others. But s*** philosophical people h*** b*** asking why _three_ dimensions particularlyâ\\x80\\x94why not another direction at right angles to the other three?â\\x80\\x94and h*** e*** tried to construct a Four-Dimensional geometry. Professor Simon Newcomb was expounding t*** to the New Y*** Mathematical Society o*** a month or so ago. You k*** how on a f*** surface, which has o*** two dimensions, we can represent a figure of a three-dimensional solid, and similarly t*** think t*** by models of three dimensions t*** could represent one of fourâ\\x80\\x94if t*** could master the perspective of the thing. See?â\\x80\\x9d â*** think so,â\\x80\\x9d murmured the Provincial Mayor; a*** knitting his brows, he lapsed i*** an introspective state, his l*** moving as one who repeats mystic words. â\\x80\\x9cYes, I think I see it now,â\\x80\\x9d he s*** after s*** time, brightening in a quite transitory manner. â\\x80\\x9cWell, I do not m*** telling you I h*** b*** at w*** u*** t*** geometry of F*** Dimensions for s*** time. S*** of my results are curious. For instance, h*** is a portrait of a man at eight years o*** another at fifteen, another at seventeen, another at twenty-three, and so on. All these are evidently sections, as it were, Three-Dimensional representations of his Four-Dimensioned being, which is a fixed and unalterable thing. â\\x80\\x9cScientific people,â\\x80\\x9d proceeded the T*** Traveller, after the pause required for the proper assimilation of this, â\\x80\\x9cknow v*** w*** t*** T*** is o*** a k*** of Space. H*** is a popular scientific diagram, a weather record. T*** l*** I trace w*** my finger shows the movement of the barometer. Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night it fell, t*** t*** morning it r*** again, and so gently upward to here. Surely the mercury did not trace t*** l*** in any of the dimensions of Space generally recognised? But certainly it traced s*** a line, and t*** line, therefore, we m*** conclude, was along the Time-Dimension.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cBut,â\\x80\\x9d s*** the Medical M*** staring h*** at a c*** in the fire, â\\x80\\x9cif T*** is really o*** a fourth dimension of Space, why is it, and why has it always been, regarded as something different? And why cannot we m*** in T*** as we m*** about in the other dimensions of Space?â\\x80\\x9d The T*** Traveller smiled. â\\x80\\x9cAre you so s*** we can m*** freely in Space? Right and l*** we can go, backward and forward freely enough, and men always h*** d*** so. I admit we m*** freely in two dimensions. But how about up and down? Gravitation limits us there.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNot exactly,â\\x80\\x9d s*** the Medical Man. â\\x80\\x9cThere are balloons.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cBut before the balloons, s*** for spasmodic jumping and the inequalities of the surface, man had no freedom of vertical movement.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cStill t*** could m*** a little up and down,â\\x80\\x9d s*** the Medical Man. â\\x80\\x9cEasier, far easier d*** t*** up.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAnd you cannot m*** at all in Time, you cannot get a*** f*** the present moment.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cMy d*** s*** t*** is j*** where you are wrong. T*** is j*** where the whole world has g*** wrong. We are always getting a*** f*** the present moment. Our mental existences, which are immaterial and h*** no dimensions, are passing along the Time-Dimension w*** a uniform velocity f*** the cradle to the grave. J*** as we should travel _down_ if we began our existence fifty miles above the earthâ\\x80\\x99s surface.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cBut the great difficulty is this,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted the Psychologist. â\\x80\\x99You _can_ m*** about in all directions of Space, but you cannot m*** about in Time.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThat is the g*** of my great discovery. But you are wrong to say t*** we cannot m*** about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling an incident v*** vividly I go b*** to the instant of its occurrence: I become absent-minded, as you say. I j*** b*** for a moment. Of course we h*** no means of staying b*** for any length of Time, any m*** t*** a savage or an animal has of staying six f*** above the ground. But a civilised man is better off t*** the savage in t*** respect. He can go up against gravitation in a balloon, and why should he not h*** t*** ultimately he may be a*** to s*** or accelerate his drift along the Time-Dimension, or e*** t*** about and travel the other way?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOh, _this_,â\\x80\\x9d began Filby, â\\x80\\x9cis allâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhy not?â\\x80\\x9d s*** the T*** Traveller. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s against reason,â\\x80\\x9d s*** Filby. â\\x80\\x9cWhat reason?â\\x80\\x9d s*** the T*** Traveller. â\\x80\\x9cYou can s*** black is white by argument,â\\x80\\x9d s*** Filby, â\\x80\\x9cbut you w*** never convince me.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cPossibly not,â\\x80\\x9d s*** the T*** Traveller. â\\x80\\x9cBut now you begin to see the object of my investigations i*** the geometry of F*** Dimensions. L*** ago I had a vague inkling of a machineâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cTo travel through Time!â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the V*** Young Man. â\\x80\\x9cThat shall travel indifferently in any direction of Space and Time, as the driver determines.â\\x80\\x9d Filby contented himself w*** laughter. â\\x80\\x9cBut I h*** experimental verification,â\\x80\\x9d s*** the T*** Traveller. â\\x80\\x9cIt would be remarkably convenient for the historian,â\\x80\\x9d the Psychologist suggested. â\\x80\\x9cOne might travel b*** and verify the accepted account of the Battle of Hastings, for instance!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t you think you would attract attention?â\\x80\\x9d s*** the Medical Man. â\\x80\\x9cOur ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOne might get oneâ\\x80\\x99s Greek f*** the v*** l*** of Homer and Plato,â\\x80\\x9d the V*** Young Man thought. â\\x80\\x9cIn which c*** t*** would certainly plough you for the Little-go. The German scholars h*** improved Greek so much.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThen there is the future,â\\x80\\x9d s*** the V*** Young Man. â\\x80\\x9cJust think! One might invest all oneâ\\x80\\x99s money, leave it to accumulate at interest, and hurry on ahead!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cTo discover a society,â\\x80\\x9d s*** I, â\\x80\\x9cerected on a strictly communistic basis.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOf all the w*** extravagant theories!â\\x80\\x9d began the Psychologist. â\\x80\\x9cYes, so it seemed to me, and so I never talked of it untilâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cExperimental verification!â\\x80\\x9d cried I. â\\x80\\x9cYou are going to verify _that_?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThe experiment!â\\x80\\x9d cried Filby, who was getting brain-weary. â\\x80\\x9cLetâ\\x80\\x99s see y*** experiment anyhow,â\\x80\\x9d s*** the Psychologist, â\\x80\\x9cthough itâ\\x80\\x99s all humbug, you know.â\\x80\\x9d The T*** Traveller smiled round at us. Then, still smiling faintly, and w*** his hands d*** in his trousers pockets, he walked slowly out of the room, and we heard his slippers shuffling d*** the l*** passage to his laboratory. The Psychologist looked at us. â*** wonder w*** heâ\\x80\\x99s got?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cSome sleight-of-hand trick or other,â\\x80\\x9d s*** the Medical M*** and Filby tried to t*** us about a conjuror he had s*** at Burslem, but before he had finished his preface the T*** Traveller c*** back, and Filbyâ\\x80\\x99s anecdote collapsed. II. The Machine The thing the T*** Traveller h*** in his h*** was a glittering metallic framework, scarcely larger t*** a small clock, and v*** delicately made. There was ivory in it, and s*** transparent crystalline substance. And now I m*** be explicit, for t*** t*** followsâ\\x80\\x94unless his explanation is to be acceptedâ\\x80\\x94is an absolutely unaccountable thing. He t*** one of the small octagonal tables t*** w*** scattered about the room, and set it in front of the fire, w*** two l*** on the hearthrug. On t*** table he placed the mechanism. T*** he d*** up a chair, and sat down. The o*** other object on the table was a small shaded lamp, the bright light of which f*** u*** the model. There w*** a*** perhaps a dozen candles about, two in brass candlesticks u*** the mantel and several in sconces, so t*** the r*** was brilliantly illuminated. I sat in a low arm-chair nearest the fire, and I d*** t*** forward so as to be almost between the T*** Traveller and the fireplace. Filby sat behind h*** looking o*** his shoulder. The Medical Man and the Provincial Mayor watched him in profile f*** the right, the Psychologist f*** the left. The V*** Young Man stood behind the Psychologist. We w*** all on the alert. It appears incredible to me t*** any k*** of trick, however subtly conceived and however adroitly done, could h*** b*** played u*** us under these conditions. The T*** Traveller looked at us, and t*** at the mechanism. â\\x80\\x9cWell?â\\x80\\x9d s*** the Psychologist. â\\x80\\x9cThis little affair,â\\x80\\x9d s*** the T*** Traveller, resting his elbows u*** the table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus, â\\x80\\x9cis o*** a model. It is my p*** for a machine to travel through time. You w*** notice t*** it looks singularly askew, and t*** there is an odd twinkling appearance about t*** b*** as though it was in s*** way unreal.â\\x80\\x9d He pointed to the p*** w*** his finger. â\\x80\\x9cAlso, h*** is one little white lever, and h*** is another.â\\x80\\x9d The Medical Man got up out of his chair and peered i*** the thing. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s beautifully made,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cIt t*** two years to make,â\\x80\\x9d retorted the T*** Traveller. Then, w*** we had all imitated the action of the Medical M*** he said: â\\x80\\x9cNow I w*** you clearly to understand t*** t*** lever, being pressed over, sends the machine gliding i*** the future, and t*** other reverses the motion. T*** saddle represents the s*** of a t*** traveller. Presently I am going to press the lever, and off the machine w*** go. It w*** vanish, p*** i*** future Time, and disappear. H*** a g*** l*** at the thing. L*** at the table t*** and satisfy yourselves there is no trickery. I donâ\\x80\\x99t w*** to waste t*** model, and t*** be t*** Iâ\\x80\\x99m a quack.â\\x80\\x9d There was a minuteâ\\x80\\x99s pause perhaps. The Psychologist seemed about to speak to me, but changed his mind. T*** the T*** Traveller put forth his finger towards the lever. â\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d he s*** suddenly. â\\x80\\x9cLend me y*** hand.â\\x80\\x9d And turning to the Psychologist, he t*** t*** individualâ\\x80\\x99s h*** in his own and t*** him to put out his forefinger. So t*** it was the Psychologist himself who s*** forth the model T*** Machine on its interminable voyage. We all saw the lever turn. I am absolutely certain there was no trickery. There was a breath of wind, and the l*** flame jumped. One of the candles on the mantel was blown o*** and the little machine suddenly swung round, became indistinct, was s*** as a ghost for a second perhaps, as an e*** of faintly glittering brass and ivory; and it was goneâ\\x80\\x94vanished! S*** for the l*** the table was bare. Everyone was silent for a minute. T*** Filby s*** he was damned. The Psychologist recovered f*** his stupor, and suddenly looked under the table. At t*** the T*** Traveller laughed cheerfully. â\\x80\\x9cWell?â\\x80\\x9d he said, w*** a reminiscence of the Psychologist. Then, getting up, he w*** to the tobacco jar on the mantel, and w*** his b*** to us began to f*** his pipe. We stared at e*** other. â\\x80\\x9cLook here,â\\x80\\x9d s*** the Medical M*** â\\x80\\x9care you in earnest about this? Do you seriously believe t*** t*** machine has travelled i*** time?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cCertainly,â\\x80\\x9d s*** the T*** Traveller, stooping to light a spill at the fire. T*** he turned, lighting his pipe, to l*** at the Psychologistâ\\x80\\x99s face. (*** Psychologist, to s*** t*** he was not unhinged, helped himself to a cigar and tried to light it uncut.) â\\x80\\x9cWhat is more, I h*** a big machine nearly finished in thereâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94he indicated the laboratoryâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cand w*** t*** is put together I m*** to h*** a journey on my own account.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYou m*** to say t*** t*** machine has travelled i*** the future?â\\x80\\x9d s*** Filby. â\\x80\\x9cInto the future or the pastâ\\x80\\x94I donâ\\x80\\x99t, for certain, k*** which.â\\x80\\x9d After an interval the Psychologist had an inspiration. â\\x80\\x9cIt m*** h*** g*** i*** the p*** if it has g*** anywhere,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cWhy?â\\x80\\x9d s*** the T*** Traveller. â\\x80\\x9cBecause I presume t*** it has not moved in space, and if it travelled i*** the future it would still be h*** all t*** time, since it m*** h*** travelled through t*** time.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cBut,â\\x80\\x9d s*** I, â\\x80\\x9cIf it travelled i*** the p*** it would h*** b*** visible w*** we c*** first i*** t*** room; and l*** Thursday w*** we w*** here; and the Thursday before that; and so forth!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cSerious objections,â\\x80\\x9d remarked the Provincial Mayor, w*** an air of impartiality, turning towards the T*** Traveller. â\\x80\\x9cNot a bit,â\\x80\\x9d s*** the T*** Traveller, a*** to the Psychologist: â\\x80\\x9cYou think. _You_ can explain that. Itâ\\x80\\x99s presentation below the threshold, you know, diluted presentation.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOf course,â\\x80\\x9d s*** the Psychologist, and reassured us. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s a simple point of psychology. I should h*** thought of it. Itâ\\x80\\x99s plain enough, and helps the paradox delightfully. We cannot see it, nor can we appreciate t*** machine, any m*** t*** we can the spoke of a wheel spinning, or a bullet flying through the air. If it is travelling through t*** fifty times or a hundred times faster t*** we a*** if it g*** through a minute while we get through a second, the impression it creates w*** of course be o*** one-fiftieth or one-hundredth of w*** it would m*** if it w*** not travelling in time. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s plain enough.â\\x80\\x9d He passed his h*** through the space in which the machine had been. â\\x80\\x9cYou see?â\\x80\\x9d he said, laughing. We sat and stared at the vacant table for a minute or so. T*** the T*** Traveller asked us w*** we thought of it all. â\\x80\\x9cIt sounds plausible enough tonight,â\\x80\\x9d s*** the Medical M*** â\\x80\\x9cbut w*** until tomorrow. W*** for the common sense of the morning.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWould you l*** to see the T*** Machine itself?â\\x80\\x9d asked the T*** Traveller. And therewith, taking the l*** in his hand, he led the way d*** the long, draughty corridor to his laboratory. I remember vividly the flickering light, his queer, broad h*** in silhouette, the dance of the shadows, how we all followed h*** puzzled but incredulous, and how there in the laboratory we beheld a larger edition of the little mechanism which we had s*** vanish f*** before our eyes. Parts w*** of nickel, parts of ivory, parts had certainly b*** filed or s*** out of r*** crystal. The thing was generally complete, but the twisted crystalline b*** lay unfinished u*** the bench beside s*** sheets of drawings, and I t*** one up for a better l*** at it. Quartz it seemed to be. â\\x80\\x9cLook here,â\\x80\\x9d s*** the Medical M*** â\\x80\\x9care you perfectly serious? Or is t*** a trickâ\\x80\\x94like t*** ghost you showed us l*** Christmas?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cUpon t*** machine,â\\x80\\x9d s*** the T*** Traveller, holding the l*** aloft, â*** intend to explore time. Is t*** plain? I was never m*** serious in my life.â\\x80\\x9d N*** of us quite k*** how to t*** it. I caught Filbyâ\\x80\\x99s eye o*** the shoulder of the Medical M*** and he winked at me solemnly. III. The T*** Traveller Returns I think t*** at t*** t*** n*** of us quite believed in the T*** Machine. The f*** is, the T*** Traveller was one of those men who are too clever to be believed: you never f*** t*** you saw all round h*** you always suspected s*** subtle reserve, s*** ingenuity in ambush, behind his lucid frankness. Had Filby shown the model and explained the matter in the T*** Travellerâ\\x80\\x99s words, we should h*** shown _him_ far l*** scepticism. For we should h*** perceived his motives: a pork-butcher could understand Filby. But the T*** Traveller had m*** t*** a touch of w*** among his elements, and we distrusted him. Things t*** would h*** m*** the f*** of a l*** clever man seemed tricks in his hands. It is a mistake to do things too easily. The serious people who t*** him seriously never f*** quite s*** of his deportment; t*** w*** somehow aware t*** trusting their reputations for judgment w*** him was l*** furnishing a nursery w*** eggshell china. So I donâ\\x80\\x99t think any of us s*** v*** m*** about t*** travelling in the interval between t*** Thursday and the next, though its odd potentialities r*** no doubt, in m*** of our minds: its plausibility, t*** is, its practical incredibleness, the curious possibilities of anachronism and of utter confusion it suggested. For my own part, I was particularly preoccupied w*** the trick of the model. T*** I remember discussing w*** the Medical M*** w*** I met on Friday at the LinnÃ¦an. He s*** he had s*** a similar thing at TÃ¼bingen, and l*** considerable stress on the blowing-out of the candle. But how the trick was d*** he could not explain. The n*** Thursday I w*** again to Richmondâ\\x80\\x94I suppose I was one of the T*** Travellerâ\\x80\\x99s m*** constant guestsâ\\x80\\x94and, arriving late, found f*** or f*** men already assembled in his drawing-room. The Medical Man was standing before the f*** w*** a sheet of paper in one h*** and his watch in the other. I looked round for the T*** Traveller, andâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s half-past seven now,â\\x80\\x9d s*** the Medical Man. â*** suppose weâ\\x80\\x99d better h*** dinner?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhereâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94?â\\x80\\x9d s*** I, naming our host. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ve j*** come? Itâ\\x80\\x99s rather odd. Heâ\\x80\\x99s unavoidably detained. He a*** me in t*** n*** to l*** off w*** dinner at seven if heâ\\x80\\x99s not back. S*** heâ\\x80\\x99ll explain w*** he comes.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIt seems a p*** to let the dinner spoil,â\\x80\\x9d s*** the Editor of a well-known daily paper; and thereupon the Doctor r*** the bell. The Psychologist was the o*** person besides the Doctor and myself who had attended the previous dinner. The other men w*** Blank, the Editor aforementioned, a certain journalist, and anotherâ\\x80\\x94a quiet, shy man w*** a beardâ\\x80\\x94whom I didnâ\\x80\\x99t know, and w*** as far as my observation went, never opened his mouth all the evening. There was s*** speculation at the dinner-table about the T*** Travellerâ\\x80\\x99s absence, and I suggested t*** travelling, in a half-jocular spirit. The Editor wanted t*** explained to h*** and the Psychologist volunteered a wooden account of the â\\x80\\x9cingenious paradox and trickâ\\x80\\x9d we had witnessed t*** day week. He was in the midst of his exposition w*** the d*** f*** the corridor opened slowly and without noise. I was facing the door, and saw it first. â\\x80\\x9cHallo!â\\x80\\x9d I said. â\\x80\\x9cAt last!â\\x80\\x9d And the d*** opened wider, and the T*** Traveller stood before us. I g*** a cry of surprise. â\\x80\\x9cGood heavens! m*** whatâ\\x80\\x99s the matter?â\\x80\\x9d cried the Medical M*** who saw him next. And the whole tableful turned towards the door. He was in an amazing plight. His c*** was dusty and dirty, and smeared w*** green d*** the sleeves; his h*** disordered, and as it seemed to me greyerâ\\x80\\x94either w*** d*** and d*** or because its colour had actually faded. His f*** was ghastly pale; his c*** had a brown cut on itâ\\x80\\x94a cut half-healed; his expression was haggard and drawn, as by intense suffering. For a moment he hesitated in the doorway, as if he had b*** dazzled by the light. T*** he c*** i*** the room. He walked w*** j*** s*** a l*** as I h*** s*** in footsore tramps. We stared at him in silence, expecting him to speak. He s*** not a word, but c*** painfully to the table, and m*** a motion towards the wine. The Editor filled a glass of champagne, and pushed it towards him. He drained it, and it seemed to do him good: for he looked round the table, and the ghost of his old smile flickered across his face. â\\x80\\x9cWhat on earth h*** you b*** up to, man?â\\x80\\x9d s*** the Doctor. The T*** Traveller did not s*** to hear. â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t let me disturb you,â\\x80\\x9d he said, w*** a certain faltering articulation. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m all right.â\\x80\\x9d He stopped, h*** out his glass for more, and t*** it off at a draught. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s good,â\\x80\\x9d he said. His e*** g*** brighter, and a faint colour c*** i*** his cheeks. His glance flickered o*** our faces w*** a certain d*** approval, and t*** w*** round the w*** and comfortable room. T*** he spoke again, still as it w*** feeling his way among his words. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m going to w*** and dress, and t*** Iâ\\x80\\x99ll c*** d*** and explain things.... S*** me s*** of t*** mutton. Iâ\\x80\\x99m starving for a bit of meat.â\\x80\\x9d He looked across at the Editor, who was a r*** visitor, and hoped he was all right. The Editor began a question. â\\x80\\x9cTell you presently,â\\x80\\x9d s*** the T*** Traveller. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99mâ\\x80\\x94funny! Be all right in a minute.â\\x80\\x9d He put d*** his glass, and walked towards the staircase door. Again I remarked his lameness and the s*** padding sound of his footfall, and standing up in my place, I saw his f*** as he w*** out. He had nothing on t*** but a p*** of tattered, blood-stained socks. T*** the d*** closed u*** him. I had h*** a m*** to follow, t*** I remembered how he detested any f*** about himself. For a minute, perhaps, my m*** was wool-gathering. Then, â\\x80\\x9cRemarkable Behaviour of an Eminent Scientist,â\\x80\\x9d I heard the Editor s*** thinking (after his wont) in headlines. And t*** brought my attention b*** to the bright dinner-table. â\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s the game?â\\x80\\x9d s*** the Journalist. â\\x80\\x9cHas he b*** doing the Amateur Cadger? I donâ\\x80\\x99t follow.â\\x80\\x9d I met the eye of the Psychologist, and r*** my own interpretation in his face. I thought of the T*** Traveller limping painfully upstairs. I donâ\\x80\\x99t think anyone e*** had noticed his lameness. The first to recover completely f*** t*** surprise was the Medical M*** who r*** the bellâ\\x80\\x94the T*** Traveller hated to h*** servants waiting at dinnerâ\\x80\\x94for a hot plate. At t*** the Editor turned to his knife and f*** w*** a grunt, and the Silent Man followed suit. The dinner was resumed. Conversation was exclamatory for a little while w*** g*** of wonderment; and t*** the Editor got fervent in his curiosity. â\\x80\\x9cDoes our friend eke out his modest income w*** a crossing? or has he his Nebuchadnezzar phases?â\\x80\\x9d he inquired. â*** f*** assured itâ\\x80\\x99s t*** business of the T*** Machine,â\\x80\\x9d I said, and t*** up the Psychologistâ\\x80\\x99s account of our previous meeting. The new guests w*** frankly incredulous. The Editor raised objections. â\\x80\\x9cWhat _was_ t*** t*** travelling? A man couldnâ\\x80\\x99t cover himself w*** d*** by rolling in a paradox, could he?â\\x80\\x9d And then, as the i*** c*** h*** to h*** he resorted to caricature. Hadnâ\\x80\\x99t t*** any clothes-brushes in the Future? The Journalist t*** would not believe at any price, and joined the Editor in the e*** w*** of heaping ridicule on the whole thing. T*** w*** b*** the new k*** of journalistâ\\x80\\x94very joyous, irreverent young men. â\\x80\\x9cOur Special Correspondent in the Day after Tomorrow reports,â\\x80\\x9d the Journalist was sayingâ\\x80\\x94or rather shoutingâ\\x80\\x94when the T*** Traveller c*** back. He was dressed in ordinary evening clothes, and nothing s*** his haggard l*** remained of the change t*** had startled me. â*** say,â\\x80\\x9d s*** the Editor hilariously, â\\x80\\x9cthese chaps h*** say you h*** b*** travelling i*** the middle of n*** week! T*** us all about little Rosebery, w*** y*** W*** w*** you t*** for the lot?â\\x80\\x9d The T*** Traveller c*** to the place reserved for him without a word. He smiled quietly, in his old way. â\\x80\\x9cWhereâ\\x80\\x99s my mutton?â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cWhat a treat it is to stick a f*** i*** m*** again!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cStory!â\\x80\\x9d cried the Editor. â\\x80\\x9cStory be damned!â\\x80\\x9d s*** the T*** Traveller. â*** w*** something to eat. I wonâ\\x80\\x99t say a w*** until I get s*** peptone i*** my arteries. Thanks. And the salt.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOne word,â\\x80\\x9d s*** I. â\\x80\\x9cHave you b*** t*** travelling?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d s*** the T*** Traveller, w*** his mouth full, nodding his head. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99d g*** a shilling a l*** for a verbatim note,â\\x80\\x9d s*** the Editor. The T*** Traveller pushed his glass towards the Silent Man and r*** it w*** his fingernail; at which the Silent M*** who had b*** staring at his face, started convulsively, and poured him wine. The r*** of the dinner was uncomfortable. For my own part, sudden questions k*** on rising to my lips, and I d*** say it was the s*** w*** the others. The Journalist tried to relieve the tension by telling anecdotes of Hettie Potter. The T*** Traveller devoted his attention to his dinner, and displayed the appetite of a tramp. The Medical Man smoked a cigarette, and watched the T*** Traveller through his eyelashes. The Silent Man seemed e*** m*** clumsy t*** usual, and drank champagne w*** regularity and determination out of sheer nervousness. At l*** the T*** Traveller pushed his plate away, and looked round us. â*** suppose I m*** apologise,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â*** was simply starving. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had a m*** amazing time.â\\x80\\x9d He reached out his h*** for a cigar, and cut the end. â\\x80\\x9cBut c*** i*** the smoking-room. Itâ\\x80\\x99s too l*** a story to t*** o*** greasy plates.â\\x80\\x9d And ringing the b*** in passing, he led the way i*** the adjoining room. â\\x80\\x9cYou h*** t*** Blank, and Dash, and Chose about the machine?â\\x80\\x9d he s*** to me, leaning b*** in his easy-chair and naming the three new guests. â\\x80\\x9cBut the thingâ\\x80\\x99s a m*** paradox,â\\x80\\x9d s*** the Editor. â*** canâ\\x80\\x99t argue tonight. I donâ\\x80\\x99t m*** telling you the story, but I canâ\\x80\\x99t argue. I will,â\\x80\\x9d he w*** on, â\\x80\\x9ctell you the story of w*** has happened to me, if you like, but you m*** refrain f*** interruptions. I w*** to t*** it. Badly. M*** of it w*** sound l*** lying. So be it! Itâ\\x80\\x99s trueâ\\x80\\x94every w*** of it, all the same. I was in my laboratory at f*** oâ\\x80\\x99clock, and since t*** â\\x80¦ Iâ\\x80\\x99ve lived eight d*** â\\x80¦ s*** d*** as no human being e*** lived before! Iâ\\x80\\x99m nearly w*** o*** but I shanâ\\x80\\x99t sleep t*** Iâ\\x80\\x99ve t*** t*** thing o*** to you. T*** I shall go to bed. But no interruptions! Is it agreed?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAgreed,â\\x80\\x9d s*** the Editor, and the r*** of us echoed â\\x80\\x9cAgreed.â\\x80\\x9d And w*** t*** the T*** Traveller began his story as I h*** set it forth. He sat b*** in his chair at first, and spoke l*** a weary man. Afterwards he got m*** animated. In writing it d*** I f*** w*** o*** too m*** keenness the inadequacy of pen and inkâ\\x80\\x94and, above a*** my own inadequacyâ\\x80\\x94to express its quality. You read, I w*** suppose, attentively enough; but you cannot see the speakerâ\\x80\\x99s white, sincere f*** in the bright circle of the little lamp, nor h*** the intonation of his voice. You cannot k*** how his expression followed the turns of his story! M*** of us hearers w*** in shadow, for the candles in the smoking-room had not b*** lighted, and o*** the f*** of the Journalist and the l*** of the Silent Man f*** the knees downward w*** illuminated. At first we glanced now and again at e*** other. After a t*** we ceased to do that, and looked o*** at the T*** Travellerâ\\x80\\x99s face. IV. T*** Travelling â*** t*** s*** of you l*** Thursday of the principles of the T*** Machine, and showed you the actual thing itself, incomplete in the workshop. There it is n*** a little travel-worn, truly; and one of the ivory b*** is cracked, and a brass r*** bent; but the r*** of itâ\\x80\\x99s sound enough. I expected to finish it on Friday; but on Friday, w*** the putting together was nearly done, I found t*** one of the nickel b*** was exactly one i*** too short, and t*** I had to get remade; so t*** the thing was not complete until t*** morning. It was at ten oâ\\x80\\x99clock today t*** the first of all T*** Machines began its career. I g*** it a l*** t*** tried all the screws again, put one m*** d*** of oil on the quartz r*** and sat myself in the saddle. I suppose a suicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels m*** the s*** wonder at w*** w*** c*** n*** as I f*** then. I t*** the starting lever in one h*** and the stopping one in the other, pressed the first, and almost immediately the second. I seemed to reel; I f*** a nightmare sensation of falling; a*** looking round, I saw the laboratory exactly as before. Had anything happened? For a moment I suspected t*** my intellect had tricked me. T*** I noted the clock. A moment before, as it seemed, it had stood at a minute or so p*** t*** now it was nearly half-past three! â*** d*** a breath, set my teeth, gripped the starting lever w*** b*** hands, and w*** off w*** a thud. The laboratory got h*** and w*** dark. Mrs. Watchett c*** in and walked, apparently without seeing me, towards the garden door. I suppose it t*** her a minute or so to traverse the place, but to me she seemed to shoot across the r*** l*** a rocket. I pressed the lever o*** to its extreme position. The night c*** l*** the turning out of a lamp, and in another moment c*** tomorrow. The laboratory g*** faint and hazy, t*** fainter and e*** fainter. Tomorrow night c*** black, t*** day again, night again, day again, faster and faster still. An eddying murmur filled my ears, and a strange, d*** confusedness descended on my mind. â*** am afraid I cannot convey the peculiar sensations of t*** travelling. T*** are excessively unpleasant. There is a feeling exactly l*** t*** one has u*** a switchbackâ\\x80\\x94of a helpless headlong motion! I f*** the s*** horrible anticipation, t*** of an imminent smash. As I put on pace, night followed day l*** the flapping of a black wing. The dim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to f*** a*** f*** me, and I saw the sun hopping swiftly across the s*** leaping it every minute, and every minute marking a day. I supposed the laboratory had b*** destroyed and I had c*** i*** the o*** air. I had a dim impression of scaffolding, but I was already going too f*** to be conscious of any moving things. The slowest snail t*** e*** crawled dashed by too f*** for me. The twinkling succession of darkness and light was excessively painful to the eye. Then, in the intermittent darknesses, I saw the m*** spinning swiftly through her quarters f*** new to full, and had a faint glimpse of the circling stars. Presently, as I w*** on, still gaining velocity, the palpitation of night and day merged i*** one continuous greyness; the sky t*** on a wonderful deepness of blue, a splendid luminous colour l*** t*** of early twilight; the jerking sun became a streak of fire, a brilliant arch, in space; the m*** a fainter fluctuating band; and I could see nothing of the stars, s*** now and t*** a brighter circle flickering in the blue. â\\x80\\x9cThe landscape was misty and vague. I was still on the hillside u*** which t*** house now stands, and the shoulder r*** above me g*** and dim. I saw trees growing and changing l*** puffs of vapour, now brown, now green; t*** grew, spread, shivered, and passed away. I saw h*** buildings r*** up faint and fair, and p*** l*** dreams. The whole surface of the earth seemed changedâ\\x80\\x94melting and flowing under my eyes. The little hands u*** the dials t*** registered my speed raced round faster and faster. Presently I noted t*** the sun b*** swayed up and down, f*** solstice to solstice, in a minute or less, and t*** consequently my p*** was o*** a y*** a minute; and minute by minute the white s*** flashed across the world, and vanished, and was followed by the bright, brief green of spring. â\\x80\\x9cThe unpleasant sensations of the start w*** l*** poignant now. T*** merged at l*** i*** a k*** of hysterical exhilaration. I remarked, indeed, a clumsy swaying of the machine, for which I was unable to account. But my m*** was too confused to attend to it, so w*** a k*** of madness growing u*** me, I flung myself i*** futurity. At first I scarce thought of stopping, scarce thought of anything but these new sensations. But presently a fresh series of impressions g*** up in my mindâ\\x80\\x94a certain curiosity and therewith a certain dreadâ\\x80\\x94until at l*** t*** t*** complete possession of me. W*** strange developments of humanity, w*** wonderful advances u*** our rudimentary civilisation, I thought, might not appear w*** I c*** to l*** nearly i*** the dim elusive world t*** raced and fluctuated before my eyes! I saw great and splendid architecture rising about me, m*** massive t*** any buildings of our own time, and y*** as it seemed, built of glimmer and mist. I saw a richer green f*** up the hillside, and remain there, without any wintry intermission. E*** through the v*** of my confusion the earth seemed v*** fair. And so my m*** c*** round to the business of stopping. â\\x80\\x9cThe peculiar r*** lay in the possibility of my finding s*** substance in the space which I, or the machine, occupied. So l*** as I travelled at a h*** velocity through time, t*** scarcely mattered: I w*** so to speak, attenuatedâ\\x80\\x94was slipping l*** a vapour through the interstices of intervening substances! But to c*** to a s*** involved the jamming of myself, molecule by molecule, i*** whatever lay in my w*** meant bringing my atoms i*** s*** intimate contact w*** those of the obstacle t*** a profound chemical reactionâ\\x80\\x94possibly a far-reaching explosionâ\\x80\\x94would result, and b*** myself and my apparatus out of all possible dimensionsâ\\x80\\x94into the Unknown. T*** possibility had occurred to me again and again while I was making the machine; but t*** I had cheerfully accepted it as an unavoidable riskâ\\x80\\x94one of the risks a man has got to take! Now the r*** was inevitable, I no longer saw it in the s*** cheerful light. The f*** is that, insensibly, the absolute strangeness of everything, the sickly jarring and swaying of the machine, above a*** the feeling of prolonged falling, had absolutely upset my nerves. I t*** myself t*** I could never stop, and w*** a g*** of petulance I resolved to s*** forthwith. L*** an impatient fool, I lugged o*** the lever, and incontinently the thing w*** reeling over, and I was flung headlong through the air. â\\x80\\x9cThere was the sound of a c*** of thunder in my ears. I may h*** b*** stunned for a moment. A pitiless h*** was hissing round me, and I was sitting on s*** t*** in front of the overset machine. Everything still seemed grey, but presently I remarked t*** the confusion in my e*** was gone. I looked round me. I was on w*** seemed to be a little l*** in a garden, surrounded by rhododendron bushes, and I noticed t*** their mauve and purple blossoms w*** dropping in a shower under the beating of the hailstones. The rebounding, dancing h*** h*** in a little cloud o*** the machine, and drove along the ground l*** smoke. In a moment I was wet to the skin. â\\x80\\x98Fine hospitality,â\\x80\\x99 s*** I, â\\x80\\x98to a man who has travelled innumerable years to see you.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x9cPresently I thought w*** a f*** I was to get wet. I stood up and looked round me. A colossal figure, carved apparently in s*** white stone, loomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the h*** downpour. But all e*** of the world was invisible. â\\x80\\x9cMy sensations would be h*** to describe. As the columns of h*** g*** thinner, I saw the white figure m*** distinctly. It was v*** large, for a silver birch-tree touched its shoulder. It was of white marble, in shape something l*** a winged sphinx, but the wings, instead of being carried vertically at the sides, w*** spread so t*** it seemed to hover. The pedestal, it appeared to me, was of bronze, and was thick w*** verdigris. It chanced t*** the f*** was towards me; the sightless e*** seemed to watch me; there was the faint shadow of a smile on the lips. It was greatly weather-worn, and t*** imparted an unpleasant suggestion of disease. I stood looking at it for a little spaceâ\\x80\\x94half a minute, perhaps, or h*** an hour. It seemed to advance and to recede as the h*** drove before it denser or thinner. At l*** I t*** my e*** f*** it for a moment, and saw t*** the h*** curtain had w*** threadbare, and t*** the sky was lightening w*** the promise of the sun. â*** looked up again at the crouching white shape, and the f*** temerity of my voyage c*** suddenly u*** me. W*** might appear w*** t*** h*** curtain was altogether withdrawn? W*** might not h*** happened to m*** W*** if cruelty had grown i*** a common passion? W*** if in t*** interval the r*** had l*** its manliness, and had developed i*** something inhuman, unsympathetic, and overwhelmingly powerful? I might s*** s*** old-world savage animal, o*** the m*** dreadful and disgusting for our common likenessâ\\x80\\x94a f*** creature to be incontinently slain. â\\x80\\x9cAlready I saw other v*** shapesâ\\x80\\x94huge buildings w*** intricate parapets and t*** columns, w*** a wooded hillside dimly creeping in u*** me through the lessening storm. I was seized w*** a panic fear. I turned frantically to the T*** Machine, and strove h*** to readjust it. As I did so the shafts of the sun smote through the thunderstorm. The g*** downpour was swept aside and vanished l*** the trailing garments of a ghost. Above me, in the intense b*** of the summer s*** s*** faint brown shreds of cloud whirled i*** nothingness. The great buildings about me stood out clear and distinct, shining w*** the wet of the thunderstorm, and picked out in white by the unmelted hailstones piled along their courses. I f*** naked in a strange world. I f*** as perhaps a b*** may f*** in the clear a*** knowing the h*** wings above and w*** swoop. My f*** g*** to frenzy. I t*** a breathing space, set my teeth, and again grappled fiercely, wrist and knee, w*** the machine. It g*** under my desperate onset and turned over. It struck my c*** violently. One h*** on the saddle, the other on the lever, I stood panting heavily in attitude to mount again. â\\x80\\x9cBut w*** t*** recovery of a prompt retreat my courage recovered. I looked m*** curiously and l*** fearfully at t*** world of the remote future. In a circular opening, h*** up in the w*** of the nearer house, I saw a group of figures c*** in r*** s*** robes. T*** had s*** me, and their faces w*** directed towards me. â\\x80\\x9cThen I heard voices approaching me. Coming through the bushes by the White Sphinx w*** the heads and shoulders of men running. One of these emerged in a pathway leading straight to the little l*** u*** which I stood w*** my machine. He was a slight creatureâ\\x80\\x94perhaps f*** f*** highâ\\x80\\x94clad in a purple tunic, girdled at the waist w*** a leather belt. Sandals or buskinsâ\\x80\\x94I could not clearly distinguish whichâ\\x80\\x94were on his feet; his l*** w*** b*** to the knees, and his h*** was bare. Noticing that, I noticed for the first t*** how w*** the air was. â\\x80\\x9cHe struck me as being a v*** beautiful and graceful creature, but indescribably frail. His flushed f*** reminded me of the m*** beautiful k*** of consumptiveâ\\x80\\x94that hectic beauty of which we u*** to h*** so much. At the sight of him I suddenly regained confidence. I t*** my hands f*** the machine. V. In the Golden Age â\\x80\\x9cIn another moment we w*** standing f*** to face, I and t*** fragile thing out of futurity. He c*** straight up to me and laughed i*** my eyes. The absence f*** his bearing of any s*** of f*** struck me at once. T*** he turned to the two others who w*** following him and spoke to t*** in a strange and v*** sweet and liquid tongue. â\\x80\\x9cThere w*** others coming, and presently a little group of perhaps eight or ten of these exquisite creatures w*** about me. One of t*** addressed me. It c*** i*** my head, oddly enough, t*** my voice was too harsh and d*** for them. So I shook my head, a*** pointing to my ears, shook it again. He c*** a s*** forward, hesitated, and t*** touched my hand. T*** I f*** other s*** little tentacles u*** my b*** and shoulders. T*** wanted to m*** s*** I was real. There was nothing in t*** at all alarming. Indeed, there was something in these pretty little people t*** inspired confidenceâ\\x80\\x94a graceful gentleness, a certain childlike ease. And besides, t*** looked so frail t*** I could fancy myself flinging the whole dozen of t*** about l*** ninepins. But I m*** a sudden motion to w*** t*** w*** I saw their little p*** hands feeling at the T*** Machine. Happily then, w*** it was not too late, I thought of a danger I had hitherto forgotten, and reaching o*** the b*** of the machine I unscrewed the little levers t*** would set it in motion, and put these in my pocket. T*** I turned again to see w*** I could do in the way of communication. â\\x80\\x9cAnd then, looking m*** nearly i*** their features, I saw s*** further peculiarities in their Dresden china t*** of prettiness. Their hair, which was uniformly curly, c*** to a sharp end at the n*** and cheek; there was not the faintest suggestion of it on the face, and their e*** w*** singularly minute. The mouths w*** small, w*** bright r*** rather t*** lips, and the little chins ran to a point. The e*** w*** large and mild; andâ\\x80\\x94this may s*** egotism on my partâ\\x80\\x94I fancied e*** t*** there was a certain l*** of the interest I might h*** expected in them. â\\x80\\x9cAs t*** m*** no effort to communicate w*** me, but simply stood round me smiling and speaking in s*** cooing notes to e*** other, I began the conversation. I pointed to the T*** Machine and to myself. Then, hesitating for a moment how to express Time, I pointed to the sun. At o*** a quaintly pretty little figure in chequered purple and white followed my gesture, and t*** astonished me by imitating the sound of thunder. â\\x80\\x9cFor a moment I was staggered, though the import of his gesture was plain enough. The question had c*** i*** my m*** abruptly: w*** these creatures fools? You may hardly understand how it t*** me. You s*** I had always anticipated t*** the people of the y*** Eight Hundred and Two Thousand odd would be incredibly in front of us in knowledge, a*** everything. T*** one of t*** suddenly asked me a question t*** showed him to be on the intellectual level of one of our five-year-old childrenâ\\x80\\x94asked me, in fact, if I had c*** f*** the sun in a thunderstorm! It let loose the judgment I had suspended u*** their clothes, their frail light limbs, and fragile features. A f*** of disappointment rushed across my mind. For a moment I f*** t*** I had built the T*** Machine in vain. â*** nodded, pointed to the s*** and g*** t*** s*** a vivid rendering of a thunderclap as startled them. T*** all withdrew a p*** or so and bowed. T*** c*** one laughing towards me, carrying a chain of beautiful flowers altogether new to me, and put it about my neck. The i*** was received w*** melodious applause; and presently t*** w*** all running to and fro for flowers, and laughingly flinging t*** u*** me until I was almost smothered w*** blossom. You who h*** never s*** the l*** can scarcely imagine w*** delicate and wonderful flowers countless years of culture had created. T*** someone suggested t*** their plaything should be exhibited in the nearest building, and so I was led p*** the sphinx of white marble, which had seemed to watch me all the while w*** a smile at my astonishment, towards a v*** g*** edifice of fretted stone. As I w*** w*** t*** the memory of my confident anticipations of a profoundly grave and intellectual posterity came, w*** irresistible merriment, to my mind. â\\x80\\x9cThe building had a h*** entry, and was altogether of colossal dimensions. I was naturally m*** occupied w*** the growing crowd of little people, and w*** the big o*** portals t*** yawned before me shadowy and mysterious. My general impression of the world I saw o*** their heads was a tangled waste of beautiful bushes and flowers, a l*** neglected and yet weedless garden. I saw a number of t*** spikes of strange white flowers, measuring a f*** perhaps across the spread of the waxen petals. T*** g*** scattered, as if wild, among the variegated shrubs, b*** as I s*** I did not examine t*** closely at t*** time. The T*** Machine was l*** deserted on the t*** among the rhododendrons. â\\x80\\x9cThe a*** of the doorway was richly carved, but naturally I did not observe the carving v*** narrowly, though I fancied I saw suggestions of old PhÅ\\x93nician decorations as I passed through, and it struck me t*** t*** w*** v*** badly broken and weather-worn. Several m*** brightly c*** people met me in the doorway, and so we entered, I, dressed in dingy nineteenth-century garments, looking grotesque enough, garlanded w*** flowers, and surrounded by an eddying m*** of bright, soft-coloured robes and shining white limbs, in a melodious whirl of laughter and laughing speech. â\\x80\\x9cThe big doorway opened i*** a proportionately great h*** h*** w*** brown. The r*** was in shadow, and the windows, partially glazed w*** coloured glass and partially unglazed, admitted a tempered light. The floor was m*** up of h*** blocks of s*** v*** h*** white metal, not plates nor slabsâ\\x80\\x94blocks, and it was so m*** worn, as I judged by the going to and fro of p*** generations, as to be deeply channelled along the m*** frequented ways. Transverse to the length w*** innumerable tables m*** of slabs of polished stone, raised, perhaps, a f*** f*** the floor, and u*** these w*** heaps of fruits. S*** I recognised as a k*** of hypertrophied raspberry and orange, but for the m*** p*** t*** w*** strange. â\\x80\\x9cBetween the tables was scattered a great number of cushions. U*** these my conductors seated themselves, signing for me to do likewise. W*** a pretty absence of ceremony t*** began to eat the fruit w*** their hands, flinging p*** and stalks, and so forth, i*** the round openings in the sides of the tables. I was not loath to follow their example, for I f*** thirsty and hungry. As I did so I surveyed the h*** at my leisure. â\\x80\\x9cAnd perhaps the thing t*** struck me m*** was its dilapidated look. The stained-glass windows, which displayed o*** a geometrical pattern, w*** broken in m*** places, and the curtains t*** h*** across the lower end w*** thick w*** dust. And it caught my eye t*** the corner of the marble table n*** me was fractured. Nevertheless, the general effect was extremely r*** and picturesque. There were, perhaps, a couple of hundred people dining in the hall, and m*** of them, seated as n*** to me as t*** could come, w*** watching me w*** interest, their little e*** shining o*** the fruit t*** w*** eating. All w*** c*** in the s*** soft, and yet strong, silky material. â\\x80\\x9cFruit, by the b*** was all their diet. These people of the remote future w*** strict vegetarians, and while I was w*** them, in spite of s*** carnal cravings, I had to be frugivorous also. Indeed, I found afterwards t*** horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, had followed the Ichthyosaurus i*** extinction. But the fruits w*** v*** delightful; o*** in particular, t*** seemed to be in season all the t*** I was thereâ\\x80\\x94a floury thing in a three-sided huskâ\\x80\\x94was especially good, and I m*** it my staple. At first I was puzzled by all these strange fruits, and by the strange flowers I s*** but later I began to perceive their import. â\\x80\\x9cHowever, I am telling you of my fruit dinner in the distant future now. So s*** as my appetite was a little checked, I determined to m*** a resolute attempt to learn the speech of these new men of mine. Clearly t*** was the n*** thing to do. The fruits seemed a convenient thing to begin upon, and holding one of these up I began a series of interrogative sounds and gestures. I had s*** considerable difficulty in conveying my meaning. At first my efforts met w*** a stare of surprise or inextinguishable laughter, but presently a fair-haired little creature seemed to grasp my intention and repeated a name. T*** had to chatter and explain the business at great length to e*** other, and my first attempts to m*** the exquisite little sounds of their language caused an immense amount of genuine, if uncivil, amusement. However, I f*** l*** a schoolmaster amidst children, and persisted, and presently I had a score of n*** substantives at least at my command; and t*** I got to demonstrative pronouns, and e*** the v*** â\\x80\\x98to eat.â\\x80\\x99 But it was s*** work, and the little people s*** tired and wanted to get a*** f*** my interrogations, so I determined, rather of necessity, to let t*** g*** their lessons in little doses w*** t*** f*** inclined. And v*** little doses I found t*** w*** before long, for I never met people m*** indolent or m*** easily fatigued. VI. The Sunset of Mankind â*** queer thing I s*** discovered about my little hosts, and t*** was their l*** of interest. T*** would c*** to me w*** eager cries of astonishment, l*** children, b*** l*** children t*** would s*** s*** examining me, and wander a*** after s*** other toy. The dinner and my conversational beginnings ended, I noted for the first t*** t*** almost all those who had surrounded me at first w*** gone. It is o*** t*** how speedily I c*** to disregard these little people. I w*** out through the portal i*** the sunlit world again as s*** as my hunger was satisfied. I was continually meeting m*** of these men of the future, who would follow me a little distance, chatter and laugh about me, a*** having smiled and gesticulated in a friendly w*** leave me again to my own devices. â\\x80\\x9cThe c*** of evening was u*** the world as I emerged f*** the great hall, and the scene was lit by the w*** g*** of the setting sun. At first things w*** v*** confusing. Everything was so entirely different f*** the world I had knownâ\\x80\\x94even the flowers. The big building I had l*** was situated on the slope of a broad river valley, but the Thames had shifted, perhaps, a m*** f*** its present position. I resolved to mount to the summit of a crest, perhaps a m*** and a h*** away, f*** which I could get a wider v*** of t*** our planet in the y*** Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred and O*** A.D. For that, I should explain, was the d*** the little dials of my machine recorded. â\\x80\\x9cAs I walked I was watching for every impression t*** could possibly h*** to explain the condition of ruinous splendour in which I found the worldâ\\x80\\x94for ruinous it was. A little way up the hill, for instance, was a great h*** of granite, bound together by masses of aluminium, a v*** labyrinth of precipitous walls and crumpled heaps, amidst which w*** thick heaps of v*** beautiful pagoda-like plantsâ\\x80\\x94nettles possiblyâ\\x80\\x94but wonderfully tinted w*** brown about the leaves, and incapable of stinging. It was evidently the derelict remains of s*** v*** structure, to w*** end built I could not determine. It was h*** t*** I was destined, at a later date, to h*** a v*** strange experienceâ\\x80\\x94the first intimation of a still stranger discoveryâ\\x80\\x94but of t*** I w*** speak in its proper place. â\\x80\\x9cLooking round, w*** a sudden thought, f*** a terrace on which I rested for a while, I realised t*** there w*** no small houses to be seen. Apparently the single house, and possibly e*** the household, had vanished. H*** and there among the greenery w*** palace-like buildings, but the house and the cottage, which f*** s*** characteristic features of our own English landscape, had disappeared. â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Communism,â\\x80\\x99 s*** I to myself. â\\x80\\x9cAnd on the heels of t*** c*** another thought. I looked at the half-dozen little figures t*** w*** following me. Then, in a flash, I perceived t*** all had the s*** f*** of costume, the s*** s*** hairless visage, and the s*** girlish rotundity of limb. It may s*** strange, perhaps, t*** I had not noticed t*** before. But everything was so strange. N*** I saw the f*** plainly enough. In costume, and in all the differences of texture and bearing t*** now m*** off the sexes f*** e*** other, these people of the future w*** alike. And the children seemed to my e*** to be but the miniatures of their parents. I judged t*** t*** the children of t*** t*** w*** extremely precocious, physically at least, and I found afterwards abundant verification of my opinion. â\\x80\\x9cSeeing the e*** and security in which these people w*** living, I f*** t*** t*** close resemblance of the sexes was after all w*** one would expect; for the strength of a man and the softness of a woman, the institution of the family, and the differentiation of occupations are m*** militant necessities of an age of physical force. Where population is balanced and abundant, m*** childbearing becomes an e*** rather t*** a blessing to the State; where violence comes but rarely and offspring are secure, there is l*** necessityâ\\x80\\x94indeed there is no necessityâ\\x80\\x94for an efficient family, and the specialisation of the sexes w*** reference to their childrenâ\\x80\\x99s needs disappears. We see s*** beginnings of t*** e*** in our own time, and in t*** future age it was complete. This, I m*** remind y*** was my speculation at the time. Later, I was to appreciate how far it f*** short of the reality. â\\x80\\x9cWhile I was musing u*** these things, my attention was attracted by a pretty little structure, l*** a w*** under a cupola. I thought in a transitory way of the oddness of wells still existing, and t*** resumed the thread of my speculations. There w*** no large buildings towards the top of the hill, and as my walking powers w*** evidently miraculous, I was presently l*** alone for the first time. W*** a strange sense of freedom and adventure I pushed on up to the crest. â\\x80\\x9cThere I found a s*** of s*** yellow metal t*** I did not recognise, corroded in places w*** a k*** of pinkish r*** and h*** smothered in s*** moss, the arm-rests c*** and filed i*** the resemblance of griffinsâ\\x80\\x99 heads. I sat d*** on it, and I surveyed the broad v*** of our old world under the sunset of t*** l*** day. It was as sweet and f*** a v*** as I h*** e*** seen. The sun had already g*** below the horizon and the w*** was flaming gold, touched w*** s*** horizontal b*** of purple and crimson. Below was the valley of the Thames, in which the river lay l*** a b*** of burnished steel. I h*** already spoken of the great palaces dotted about among the variegated greenery, s*** in ruins and s*** still occupied. H*** and there r*** a white or silvery figure in the waste garden of the earth, h*** and there c*** the sharp vertical l*** of s*** cupola or obelisk. There w*** no hedges, no signs of proprietary rights, no evidences of agriculture; the whole earth had become a garden. â\\x80\\x9cSo watching, I began to put my interpretation u*** the things I had seen, and as it shaped itself to me t*** evening, my interpretation was something in t*** way. (Afterwards I found I had got o*** a h*** truthâ\\x80\\x94or o*** a glimpse of one facet of the truth.) â\\x80\\x9cIt seemed to me t*** I had happened u*** humanity u*** the wane. The ruddy sunset set me thinking of the sunset of mankind. For the first t*** I began to realise an odd consequence of the social effort in which we are at present engaged. And y*** c*** to think, it is a logical consequence enough. Strength is the outcome of need; security s*** a premium on feebleness. The w*** of ameliorating the conditions of lifeâ\\x80\\x94the t*** civilising process t*** makes l*** m*** and m*** secureâ\\x80\\x94had g*** steadily on to a climax. One triumph of a united humanity o*** Nature had followed another. Things t*** are now m*** dreams had become projects deliberately put in h*** and carried forward. And the harvest was w*** I s*** â\\x80\\x9cAfter a*** the sanitation and the agriculture of today are still in the rudimentary stage. The science of our t*** has attacked but a little department of the field of human disease, b*** e*** so, it spreads its operations v*** steadily and persistently. Our agriculture and horticulture destroy a w*** j*** h*** and there and cultivate perhaps a score or so of wholesome plants, leaving the greater number to fight out a balance as t*** can. We improve our favourite plants and animalsâ\\x80\\x94and how few t*** areâ\\x80\\x94gradually by selective breeding; now a new and better peach, now a seedless grape, now a sweeter and larger flower, now a m*** convenient breed of cattle. We improve t*** gradually, because our ideals are vague and tentative, and our knowledge is v*** limited; because Nature, t*** is shy and s*** in our clumsy hands. S*** day all t*** w*** be better organised, and still better. T*** is the drift of the current in spite of the eddies. The whole world w*** be intelligent, educated, and co-operating; things w*** m*** faster and faster towards the subjugation of Nature. In the e*** wisely and carefully we shall readjust the balance of animal and vegetable l*** to s*** our human needs. â\\x80\\x9cThis adjustment, I s*** m*** h*** b*** done, and d*** well; d*** indeed for all Time, in the space of T*** across which my machine had leapt. The air was f*** f*** gnats, the earth f*** weeds or fungi; everywhere w*** fruits and sweet and delightful flowers; brilliant butterflies f*** hither and thither. The ideal of preventive medicine was attained. Diseases had b*** stamped out. I saw no evidence of any contagious diseases during all my stay. And I shall h*** to t*** you later t*** e*** the processes of putrefaction and decay had b*** profoundly affected by these changes. â\\x80\\x9cSocial triumphs, t*** had b*** effected. I saw mankind housed in splendid shelters, gloriously clothed, and as yet I had found t*** engaged in no toil. There w*** no signs of struggle, neither social nor economical struggle. The shop, the advertisement, traffic, all t*** commerce which constitutes the b*** of our world, was gone. It was natural on t*** golden evening t*** I should j*** at the i*** of a social paradise. The difficulty of increasing population had b*** m*** I guessed, and population had ceased to increase. â\\x80\\x9cBut w*** t*** change in condition comes inevitably adaptations to the change. What, unless biological science is a m*** of errors, is the cause of human intelligence and vigour? Hardship and freedom: conditions under which the active, strong, and subtle survive and the weaker go to the wall; conditions t*** put a premium u*** the loyal alliance of capable m*** u*** self-restraint, patience, and decision. And the institution of the family, and the emotions t*** arise therein, the fierce jealousy, the tenderness for offspring, parental self-devotion, all found their justification and support in the imminent dangers of the young. _Now_, where are these imminent dangers? There is a sentiment arising, and it w*** grow, against connubial jealousy, against fierce maternity, against passion of all sorts; unnecessary things n*** and things t*** m*** us uncomfortable, savage survivals, discords in a refined and pleasant life. â*** thought of the physical slightness of the people, their l*** of intelligence, and those big abundant ruins, and it strengthened my belief in a perfect conquest of Nature. For after the battle comes Quiet. Humanity had b*** strong, energetic, and intelligent, and had u*** all its abundant vitality to alter the conditions under which it lived. And now c*** the reaction of the altered conditions. â\\x80\\x9cUnder the new conditions of perfect comfort and security, t*** restless energy, t*** w*** us is strength, would become weakness. E*** in our own t*** certain tendencies and desires, o*** necessary to survival, are a constant source of failure. Physical courage and the l*** of battle, for instance, are no great helpâ\\x80\\x94may e*** be hindrancesâ\\x80\\x94to a civilised man. And in a state of physical balance and security, power, intellectual as w*** as physical, would be out of place. For countless years I judged there had b*** no danger of war or solitary violence, no danger f*** w*** beasts, no wasting disease to require strength of constitution, no n*** of toil. For s*** a life, w*** we should c*** the w*** are as w*** equipped as the strong, are indeed no longer weak. Better equipped indeed t*** a*** for the strong would be fretted by an energy for which there was no outlet. No doubt the exquisite beauty of the buildings I saw was the outcome of the l*** surgings of the now purposeless energy of mankind before it settled d*** i*** perfect harmony w*** the conditions under which it livedâ\\x80\\x94the flourish of t*** triumph which began the l*** great peace. T*** has e*** b*** the f*** of energy in security; it takes to art and to eroticism, and t*** c*** languor and decay. â\\x80\\x9cEven t*** artistic impetus would at l*** die awayâ\\x80\\x94had almost d*** in the T*** I saw. To adorn themselves w*** flowers, to dance, to s*** in the sunlight: so m*** was l*** of the artistic spirit, and no more. E*** t*** would f*** in the end i*** a contented inactivity. We are k*** k*** on the grindstone of p*** and necessity, and it seemed to me t*** h*** was t*** hateful grindstone broken at last! â\\x80\\x9cAs I stood there in the gathering d*** I thought t*** in t*** simple explanation I had mastered the problem of the worldâ\\x80\\x94mastered the whole secret of these delicious people. Possibly the checks t*** had devised for the increase of population had succeeded too well, and their numbers had rather diminished t*** k*** stationary. T*** would account for the abandoned ruins. V*** simple was my explanation, and plausible enoughâ\\x80\\x94as m*** wrong theories a*** VII. A Sudden Shock â\\x80\\x9cAs I stood there musing o*** t*** too perfect triumph of m*** the f*** moon, yellow and gibbous, c*** up out of an overflow of silver light in the north-east. The bright little figures ceased to m*** about below, a noiseless owl flitted by, and I shivered w*** the chill of the night. I determined to descend and f*** where I could sleep. â*** looked for the building I knew. T*** my eye travelled along to the figure of the White Sphinx u*** the pedestal of bronze, growing distinct as the light of the rising m*** g*** brighter. I could see the silver birch against it. There was the tangle of rhododendron bushes, black in the p*** light, and there was the little lawn. I looked at the l*** again. A queer doubt chilled my complacency. â\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 s*** I stoutly to myself, â\\x80\\x98that was not the lawn.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x9cBut it _was_ the lawn. For the white leprous f*** of the sphinx was towards it. Can you imagine w*** I f*** as t*** conviction c*** h*** to me? But you cannot. The T*** Machine was gone! â\\x80\\x9cAt once, l*** a l*** across the face, c*** the possibility of losing my own a*** of being l*** helpless in t*** strange new world. The b*** thought of it was an actual physical sensation. I could f*** it g*** me at the throat and s*** my breathing. In another moment I was in a passion of f*** and running w*** great leaping strides d*** the slope. O*** I f*** headlong and cut my face; I l*** no t*** in stanching the blood, but jumped up and ran on, w*** a w*** trickle d*** my cheek and chin. All the t*** I ran I was saying to myself: â\\x80\\x98They h*** moved it a little, pushed it under the bushes out of the way.â\\x80\\x99 Nevertheless, I ran w*** all my might. All the time, w*** the certainty t*** sometimes comes w*** excessive dread, I k*** t*** s*** assurance was folly, k*** instinctively t*** the machine was removed out of my reach. My breath c*** w*** pain. I suppose I covered the whole distance f*** the h*** crest to the little lawn, two miles perhaps, in ten minutes. And I am not a young man. I cursed aloud, as I r*** at my confident folly in leaving the machine, wasting g*** breath thereby. I cried aloud, and n*** answered. Not a creature seemed to be stirring in t*** moonlit world. â\\x80\\x9cWhen I reached the l*** my worst fears w*** realised. Not a trace of the thing was to be seen. I f*** faint and c*** w*** I faced the empty space among the black tangle of bushes. I ran round it furiously, as if the thing might be hidden in a corner, and t*** stopped abruptly, w*** my hands clutching my hair. Above me towered the sphinx, u*** the bronze pedestal, white, shining, leprous, in the light of the rising moon. It seemed to smile in mockery of my dismay. â*** might h*** consoled myself by imagining the little people had put the mechanism in s*** shelter for me, had I not f*** assured of their physical and intellectual inadequacy. T*** is w*** dismayed me: the sense of s*** hitherto unsuspected power, through whose intervention my invention had vanished. Y*** for one thing I f*** assured: unless s*** other age had produced its exact duplicate, the machine could not h*** moved in time. The attachment of the leversâ\\x80\\x94I w*** s*** you the method laterâ\\x80\\x94prevented anyone f*** tampering w*** it in t*** way w*** t*** w*** removed. It had moved, and was h*** o*** in space. But then, where could it be? â*** think I m*** h*** had a k*** of frenzy. I remember running violently in and out among the moonlit bushes all round the sphinx, and startling s*** white animal that, in the dim light, I t*** for a small deer. I remember, t*** l*** t*** night, beating the bushes w*** my clenched f*** until my knuckles w*** gashed and bleeding f*** the broken twigs. Then, sobbing and raving in my anguish of mind, I w*** d*** to the great building of stone. The big h*** was dark, silent, and deserted. I slipped on the uneven floor, and f*** o*** one of the malachite tables, almost breaking my shin. I lit a match and w*** on p*** the dusty curtains, of which I h*** t*** you. â\\x80\\x9cThere I found a second great h*** covered w*** cushions, u*** which, perhaps, a score or so of the little people w*** sleeping. I h*** no doubt t*** found my second appearance strange enough, coming suddenly out of the quiet darkness w*** inarticulate noises and the splutter and flare of a match. For t*** had forgotten about matches. â\\x80\\x98Where is my T*** Machine?â\\x80\\x99 I began, bawling l*** an angry child, laying hands u*** t*** and shaking t*** up together. It m*** h*** b*** v*** queer to them. S*** laughed, m*** of t*** looked sorely frightened. W*** I saw t*** standing round me, it c*** i*** my h*** t*** I was doing as foolish a thing as it was possible for me to do under the circumstances, in trying to revive the sensation of fear. F*** reasoning f*** their daylight behaviour, I thought t*** f*** m*** be forgotten. â\\x80\\x9cAbruptly, I dashed d*** the match, and knocking one of the people o*** in my course, w*** blundering across the big dining-hall again, out under the moonlight. I heard cries of terror and their little f*** running and stumbling t*** way and that. I do not remember all I did as the m*** crept up the sky. I suppose it was the unexpected nature of my l*** t*** maddened me. I f*** hopelessly cut off f*** my own kindâ\\x80\\x94a strange animal in an unknown world. I m*** h*** raved to and f*** screaming and crying u*** God and Fate. I h*** a memory of horrible fatigue, as the l*** night of despair w*** away; of looking in t*** impossible place and that; of groping among moonlit ruins and touching strange creatures in the black shadows; at last, of lying on the ground n*** the sphinx and weeping w*** absolute wretchedness, e*** anger at the folly of leaving the machine having leaked a*** w*** my strength. I had nothing l*** but misery. T*** I slept, and w*** I w*** again it was f*** d*** and a couple of sparrows w*** hopping round me on the t*** within reach of my arm. â*** sat up in the freshness of the morning, trying to remember how I had got there, and why I had s*** a profound sense of desertion and despair. T*** things c*** clear in my mind. W*** the plain, reasonable daylight, I could l*** my circumstances fairly in the face. I saw the w*** folly of my frenzy overnight, and I could reason w*** myself. â\\x80\\x98Suppose the worst?â\\x80\\x99 I said. â\\x80\\x98Suppose the machine altogether lostâ\\x80\\x94perhaps destroyed? It behoves me to be c*** and patient, to learn the way of the people, to get a clear i*** of the method of my loss, and the means of getting materials and tools; so t*** in the e*** perhaps, I may m*** another.â\\x80\\x99 T*** would be my o*** hope, a p*** hope, perhaps, but better t*** despair. A*** after a*** it was a beautiful and curious world. â\\x80\\x9cBut probably the machine had o*** b*** taken away. Still, I m*** be c*** and patient, f*** its hiding-place, and recover it by force or cunning. And w*** t*** I scrambled to my f*** and looked about me, wondering where I could bathe. I f*** weary, stiff, and travel-soiled. The freshness of the morning m*** me desire an equal freshness. I had exhausted my emotion. Indeed, as I w*** about my business, I found myself wondering at my intense excitement overnight. I m*** a careful examination of the ground about the little lawn. I wasted s*** t*** in futile questionings, conveyed, as w*** as I was able, to s*** of the little people as c*** by. T*** all failed to understand my gestures; s*** w*** simply stolid, s*** thought it was a j*** and laughed at me. I had the hardest t*** in the world to k*** my hands off their pretty laughing faces. It was a foolish impulse, but the devil begotten of f*** and blind anger was ill curbed and still eager to t*** advantage of my perplexity. The t*** g*** better counsel. I found a groove ripped in it, about midway between the pedestal of the sphinx and the marks of my f*** where, on arrival, I had struggled w*** the overturned machine. There w*** other signs of removal about, w*** queer narrow footprints l*** those I could imagine m*** by a sloth. T*** directed my closer attention to the pedestal. It w*** as I think I h*** said, of bronze. It was not a m*** block, but highly decorated w*** d*** framed panels on either side. I w*** and rapped at these. The pedestal was hollow. Examining the panels w*** c*** I found t*** discontinuous w*** the frames. There w*** no handles or keyholes, but possibly the panels, if t*** w*** doors, as I supposed, opened f*** within. One thing was clear enough to my mind. It t*** no v*** great mental effort to infer t*** my T*** Machine was inside t*** pedestal. But how it got there was a different problem. â*** saw the heads of two orange-clad people coming through the bushes and under s*** blossom-covered apple-trees towards me. I turned smiling to them, and beckoned t*** to me. T*** came, and then, pointing to the bronze pedestal, I tried to intimate my w*** to o*** it. But at my first gesture towards t*** t*** behaved v*** oddly. I donâ\\x80\\x99t k*** how to convey their expression to you. Suppose you w*** to use a grossly improper gesture to a delicate-minded womanâ\\x80\\x94it is how she would look. T*** w*** off as if t*** had received the l*** possible insult. I tried a sweet-looking little c*** in white next, w*** exactly the s*** result. Somehow, his manner m*** me f*** ashamed of myself. B*** as you know, I wanted the T*** Machine, and I tried him o*** more. As he turned o*** l*** the others, my temper got the better of me. In three strides I was after h*** had him by the loose p*** of his r*** round the neck, and began dragging him towards the sphinx. T*** I saw the horror and repugnance of his face, and all of a sudden I let him go. â\\x80\\x9cBut I was not beaten yet. I banged w*** my f*** at the bronze panels. I thought I heard something s*** insideâ\\x80\\x94to be explicit, I thought I heard a sound l*** a chuckleâ\\x80\\x94but I m*** h*** b*** mistaken. T*** I got a big pebble f*** the river, and c*** and hammered t*** I had flattened a c*** in the decorations, and the verdigris c*** off in powdery flakes. The delicate little people m*** h*** heard me hammering in gusty outbreaks a m*** a*** on either hand, but nothing c*** of it. I saw a crowd of t*** u*** the slopes, looking furtively at me. At last, hot and tired, I sat d*** to watch the place. But I was too restless to watch long; I am too Occidental for a l*** vigil. I could w*** at a problem for years, but to w*** inactive for twenty-four hoursâ\\x80\\x94that is another matter. â*** got up after a time, and began walking aimlessly through the bushes towards the h*** again. â\\x80\\x98Patience,â\\x80\\x99 s*** I to myself. â\\x80\\x98If you w*** y*** machine again you m*** leave t*** sphinx alone. If t*** m*** to t*** y*** machine away, itâ\\x80\\x99s little g*** y*** wrecking their bronze panels, and if t*** donâ\\x80\\x99t, you w*** get it b*** as s*** as you can ask for it. To sit among all those unknown things before a puzzle l*** t*** is hopeless. T*** way l*** monomania. F*** t*** world. Learn its ways, watch it, be careful of too hasty guesses at its meaning. In the end you w*** f*** clues to it all.â\\x80\\x99 T*** suddenly the humour of the situation c*** i*** my mind: the thought of the years I had spent in study and t*** to get i*** the future a*** and now my passion of anxiety to get out of it. I had m*** myself the m*** complicated and the m*** hopeless t*** t*** e*** a man devised. Although it was at my own expense, I could not h*** myself. I laughed aloud. â\\x80\\x9cGoing through the big palace, it seemed to me t*** the little people avoided me. It may h*** b*** my fancy, or it may h*** had something to do w*** my hammering at the gates of bronze. Yet I f*** tolerably s*** of the avoidance. I was careful, however, to s*** no concern and to abstain f*** any pursuit of them, and in the course of a day or two things got b*** to the old footing. I m*** w*** progress I could in the language, and in addition I pushed my explorations h*** and there. Either I missed s*** subtle point or their language was excessively simpleâ\\x80\\x94almost exclusively composed of concrete substantives and verbs. There seemed to be f*** if a*** abstract terms, or little use of figurative language. Their sentences w*** usually simple and of two words, and I failed to convey or understand any but the simplest propositions. I determined to put the thought of my T*** Machine and the mystery of the bronze doors under the sphinx, as m*** as possible in a corner of memory, until my growing knowledge would l*** me b*** to t*** in a natural way. Yet a certain feeling, you may understand, tethered me in a circle of a few miles round the point of my arrival. VIII. Explanation â\\x80\\x9cSo far as I could s*** all the world displayed the s*** exuberant richness as the Thames valley. F*** every h*** I climbed I saw the s*** abundance of splendid buildings, endlessly varied in material and style, the s*** clustering thickets of evergreens, the s*** blossom-laden trees and t*** ferns. H*** and there water shone l*** silver, and beyond, the l*** r*** i*** b*** undulating hills, and so faded i*** the serenity of the sky. A peculiar feature, which presently attracted my attention, was the presence of certain circular wells, several, as it seemed to me, of a v*** great depth. One lay by the p*** up the h*** which I had followed during my first walk. L*** the others, it was rimmed w*** bronze, curiously wrought, and protected by a little cupola f*** the rain. Sitting by the s*** of these wells, and peering d*** i*** the shafted darkness, I could see no gleam of water, nor could I start any reflection w*** a lighted match. But in all of t*** I heard a certain sound: a thudâ\\x80\\x94thudâ\\x80\\x94thud, l*** the beating of s*** big engine; and I discovered, f*** the flaring of my matches, t*** a steady current of air set d*** the shafts. Further, I threw a scrap of paper i*** the throat of o*** a*** instead of fluttering slowly down, it was at o*** sucked swiftly out of sight. â\\x80\\x9cAfter a time, t*** I c*** to connect these wells w*** t*** towers standing h*** and there u*** the slopes; for above t*** there was often j*** s*** a flicker in the air as one s*** on a hot day above a sun-scorched beach. Putting things together, I reached a strong suggestion of an extensive system of subterranean ventilation, whose t*** import it was difficult to imagine. I was at first inclined to associate it w*** the sanitary apparatus of these people. It was an obvious conclusion, but it was absolutely wrong. â\\x80\\x9cAnd h*** I m*** admit t*** I learnt v*** little of drains and bells and modes of conveyance, and the l*** conveniences, during my t*** in t*** r*** future. In s*** of these visions of Utopias and coming times which I h*** read, there is a v*** amount of detail about building, and social arrangements, and so forth. But while s*** details are e*** enough to obtain w*** the whole world is contained in oneâ\\x80\\x99s imagination, t*** are altogether inaccessible to a r*** traveller a*** s*** realities as I found here. Conceive the t*** of London which a negro, fresh f*** Central Africa, would t*** b*** to his tribe! W*** would he k*** of railway companies, of social movements, of telephone and telegraph wires, of the Parcels Delivery Company, and postal orders and the like? Yet we, at least, should be willing enough to explain these things to h*** And e*** of w*** he knew, how m*** could he m*** his untravelled friend either apprehend or believe? Then, think how narrow the gap between a negro and a white man of our own times, and how w*** the interval between myself and these of the Golden A*** I was sensible of m*** which was unseen, and which contributed to my comfort; but s*** for a general impression of automatic organisation, I f*** I can convey v*** little of the difference to y*** mind. â\\x80\\x9cIn the matter of sepulture, for instance, I could see no signs of crematoria nor anything suggestive of tombs. But it occurred to me that, possibly, there might be cemeteries (or crematoria) somewhere beyond the range of my explorings. This, again, was a question I deliberately put to myself, and my curiosity was at first entirely defeated u*** the point. The thing puzzled me, and I was led to m*** a further remark, which puzzled me still more: t*** a*** and infirm among t*** people there w*** none. â*** m*** confess t*** my satisfaction w*** my first theories of an automatic civilisation and a decadent humanity did not l*** endure. Yet I could think of no other. Let me put my difficulties. The several big palaces I had explored w*** m*** living places, great dining-halls and sleeping apartments. I could f*** no machinery, no appliances of any kind. Yet these people w*** clothed in pleasant fabrics t*** m*** at times n*** renewal, and their sandals, though undecorated, w*** fairly complex specimens of metalwork. Somehow s*** things m*** be made. And the little people displayed no vestige of a creative tendency. There w*** no shops, no workshops, no s*** of importations among them. T*** spent all their t*** in playing gently, in bathing in the river, in making l*** in a half-playful fashion, in eating fruit and sleeping. I could not see how things w*** k*** going. â\\x80\\x9cThen, again, about the T*** Machine: something, I k*** not what, had taken it i*** the hollow pedestal of the White Sphinx. _Why?_ For the l*** of me I could not imagine. Those waterless wells, t*** those flickering pillars. I f*** I lacked a clue. I feltâ\\x80\\x94how shall I put it? Suppose you found an inscription, w*** sentences h*** and there in excellent plain English, and interpolated therewith, others m*** up of words, of letters even, absolutely unknown to y*** Well, on the third day of my visit, t*** was how the world of Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred and One presented itself to me! â\\x80\\x9cThat d*** t*** I m*** a friendâ\\x80\\x94of a sort. It happened that, as I was watching s*** of the little people bathing in a shallow, one of t*** was seized w*** cramp and began drifting downstream. The m*** current ran rather swiftly, but not too strongly for e*** a moderate swimmer. It w*** g*** you an idea, therefore, of the strange deficiency in these creatures, w*** I t*** you t*** n*** m*** the slightest attempt to rescue the weakly crying little thing which was drowning before their eyes. W*** I realised this, I hurriedly slipped off my clothes, a*** wading in at a point lower down, I caught the p*** m*** and d*** her s*** to land. A little rubbing of the limbs s*** brought her round, and I had the satisfaction of seeing she was all right before I l*** her. I had got to s*** a low estimate of her k*** t*** I did not expect any gratitude f*** her. In that, however, I was wrong. â\\x80\\x9cThis happened in the morning. In the afternoon I met my little woman, as I believe it w*** as I was returning towards my centre f*** an exploration, and she received me w*** cries of delight and presented me w*** a big garland of flowersâ\\x80\\x94evidently m*** for me and me alone. The thing t*** my imagination. V*** possibly I had b*** feeling desolate. At any r*** I did my b*** to display my appreciation of the gift. We w*** s*** seated together in a little stone arbour, engaged in conversation, chiefly of smiles. The creatureâ\\x80\\x99s friendliness affected me exactly as a childâ\\x80\\x99s might h*** done. We passed e*** other flowers, and she kissed my hands. I did the s*** to hers. T*** I tried talk, and found t*** her n*** was Weena, which, though I donâ\\x80\\x99t k*** w*** it meant, somehow seemed appropriate enough. T*** was the beginning of a queer friendship which lasted a week, and endedâ\\x80\\x94as I w*** t*** y*** â\\x80\\x9cShe was exactly l*** a child. She wanted to be w*** me always. She tried to follow me everywhere, and on my n*** journey out and about it w*** to my heart to t*** her down, and leave her at last, exhausted and calling after me rather plaintively. But the problems of the world had to be mastered. I had n*** I s*** to myself, c*** i*** the future to carry on a miniature flirtation. Yet her distress w*** I l*** her was v*** great, her expostulations at the parting w*** sometimes frantic, and I think, altogether, I had as m*** trouble as comfort f*** her devotion. Nevertheless she w*** somehow, a v*** great comfort. I thought it was m*** childish affection t*** m*** her cling to me. Until it was too late, I did not clearly k*** w*** I had inflicted u*** her w*** I l*** her. Nor until it was too l*** did I clearly understand w*** she was to me. F*** by merely seeming f*** of me, and showing in her weak, futile way t*** she cared for me, the little d*** of a creature presently g*** my return to the neighbourhood of the White Sphinx almost the feeling of coming home; and I would watch for her t*** figure of white and g*** so s*** as I c*** o*** the hill. â\\x80\\x9cIt was f*** h*** t*** t*** I learnt t*** f*** had not yet l*** the world. She was fearless enough in the daylight, and she had the oddest confidence in me; for once, in a foolish moment, I m*** threatening grimaces at h*** and she simply laughed at them. But she dreaded the dark, dreaded shadows, dreaded black things. Darkness to her was the one thing dreadful. It was a singularly passionate emotion, and it set me thinking and observing. I discovered then, among other things, t*** these little people gathered i*** the great houses after dark, and slept in droves. To enter u*** t*** without a light was to put t*** i*** a tumult of apprehension. I never found one out of doors, or one sleeping alone within doors, after dark. Yet I was still s*** a blockhead t*** I missed the lesson of t*** fear, and in spite of Weenaâ\\x80\\x99s distress, I insisted u*** sleeping a*** f*** these slumbering multitudes. â\\x80\\x9cIt troubled her greatly, but in the end her odd affection for me triumphed, and for f*** of the nights of our acquaintance, including the l*** night of a*** she slept w*** her h*** pillowed on my arm. But my story slips a*** f*** me as I speak of her. It m*** h*** b*** the night before her rescue t*** I was awakened about dawn. I had b*** restless, dreaming m*** disagreeably t*** I was drowned, and t*** sea anemones w*** feeling o*** my f*** w*** their s*** palps. I w*** w*** a start, and w*** an odd fancy t*** s*** greyish animal had j*** rushed out of the chamber. I tried to get to sleep again, but I f*** restless and uncomfortable. It was t*** dim g*** h*** w*** things are j*** creeping out of darkness, w*** everything is colourless and clear c*** and yet unreal. I got up, and w*** d*** i*** the great hall, and so out u*** the flagstones in front of the palace. I thought I would m*** a virtue of necessity, and see the sunrise. â\\x80\\x9cThe m*** was setting, and the dying moonlight and the first pallor of d*** w*** mingled in a ghastly half-light. The bushes w*** i*** black, the ground a sombre grey, the sky colourless and cheerless. And up the h*** I thought I could see ghosts. Three several times, as I scanned the slope, I saw white figures. Twice I fancied I saw a solitary white, ape-like creature running rather quickly up the hill, and o*** n*** the ruins I saw a leash of t*** carrying s*** d*** body. T*** moved hastily. I did not see w*** became of them. It seemed t*** t*** vanished among the bushes. The d*** was still indistinct, you m*** understand. I was feeling t*** chill, uncertain, early-morning feeling you may h*** known. I doubted my eyes. â\\x80\\x9cAs the eastern sky g*** brighter, and the light of the day c*** on and its vivid colouring returned u*** the world o*** more, I scanned the v*** keenly. But I saw no vestige of my white figures. T*** w*** m*** creatures of the half-light. â\\x80\\x98They m*** h*** b*** ghosts,â\\x80\\x99 I said; â*** wonder whence t*** dated.â\\x80\\x99 For a queer notion of Grant Allenâ\\x80\\x99s c*** i*** my head, and amused me. If e*** generation die and leave ghosts, he argued, the world at l*** w*** get overcrowded w*** them. On t*** theory t*** would h*** grown innumerable s*** Eight Hundred Thousand Years hence, and it was no great wonder to see f*** at once. But the j*** was unsatisfying, and I was thinking of these figures all the morning, until Weenaâ\\x80\\x99s rescue drove t*** out of my head. I associated t*** in s*** indefinite way w*** the white animal I had startled in my first passionate search for the T*** Machine. But Weena was a pleasant substitute. Yet all the same, t*** w*** s*** destined to t*** far deadlier possession of my mind. â*** think I h*** s*** how m*** hotter t*** our own was the weather of t*** Golden Age. I cannot account for it. It may be t*** the sun was hotter, or the earth nearer the sun. It is usual to assume t*** the sun w*** go on cooling steadily in the future. But people, unfamiliar w*** s*** speculations as those of the younger Darwin, forget t*** the planets m*** ultimately f*** b*** one by one i*** the parent body. As these catastrophes occur, the sun w*** blaze w*** renewed energy; and it may be t*** s*** inner planet had suffered t*** fate. Whatever the reason, the f*** remains t*** the sun was v*** m*** hotter t*** we k*** it. â\\x80\\x9cWell, one v*** hot morningâ\\x80\\x94my fourth, I thinkâ\\x80\\x94as I was seeking shelter f*** the h*** and glare in a colossal r*** n*** the great house where I slept and f*** there happened t*** strange thing. Clambering among these heaps of masonry, I found a narrow gallery, whose end and s*** windows w*** blocked by fallen masses of stone. By contrast w*** the brilliancy outside, it seemed at first impenetrably d*** to me. I entered it groping, for the change f*** light to blackness m*** spots of colour s*** before me. Suddenly I halted spellbound. A p*** of eyes, luminous by reflection against the daylight without, was watching me out of the darkness. â\\x80\\x9cThe old instinctive dread of w*** beasts c*** u*** me. I clenched my hands and steadfastly looked i*** the glaring eyeballs. I was afraid to turn. T*** the thought of the absolute security in which humanity appeared to be living c*** to my mind. And t*** I remembered t*** strange terror of the dark. Overcoming my f*** to s*** extent, I advanced a s*** and spoke. I w*** admit t*** my voice was harsh and ill-controlled. I put out my h*** and touched something soft. At o*** the e*** darted sideways, and something white ran p*** me. I turned w*** my heart in my mouth, and saw a queer little ape-like figure, its h*** h*** d*** in a peculiar manner, running across the sunlit space behind me. It blundered against a block of granite, staggered aside, and in a moment was hidden in a black shadow beneath another p*** of ruined masonry. â\\x80\\x9cMy impression of it is, of course, imperfect; but I k*** it was a d*** white, and had strange large greyish-red eyes; a*** t*** there was flaxen h*** on its h*** and d*** its back. B*** as I s*** it w*** too f*** for me to see distinctly. I cannot e*** say whether it ran on all fours, or o*** w*** its forearms h*** v*** low. After an instantâ\\x80\\x99s pause I followed it i*** the second h*** of ruins. I could not f*** it at first; b*** after a t*** in the profound obscurity, I c*** u*** one of those round well-like openings of which I h*** t*** y*** h*** closed by a fallen pillar. A sudden thought c*** to me. Could t*** Thing h*** vanished d*** the shaft? I lit a match, a*** looking down, I saw a small, white, moving creature, w*** large bright e*** which regarded me steadfastly as it retreated. It m*** me shudder. It was so l*** a human spider! It was clambering d*** the wall, and now I saw for the first t*** a number of metal f*** and h*** rests forming a k*** of ladder d*** the shaft. T*** the light burned my fingers and f*** out of my hand, going out as it dropped, and w*** I had lit another the little monster had disappeared. â*** do not k*** how l*** I sat peering d*** t*** well. It was not for s*** t*** t*** I could succeed in persuading myself t*** the thing I had s*** was human. B*** gradually, the truth dawned on me: t*** Man had not remained one species, but had differentiated i*** two distinct animals: t*** my graceful children of the Upper World w*** not the s*** descendants of our generation, but t*** t*** bleached, obscene, nocturnal Thing, which had flashed before me, was a*** h*** to all the ages. â*** thought of the flickering pillars and of my theory of an underground ventilation. I began to suspect their t*** import. And what, I wondered, was t*** Lemur doing in my scheme of a perfectly balanced organisation? How was it related to the indolent serenity of the beautiful Overworlders? And w*** was hidden d*** there, at the f*** of t*** shaft? I sat u*** the e*** of the w*** telling myself that, at any rate, there was nothing to fear, and t*** there I m*** descend for the solution of my difficulties. And withal I was absolutely afraid to go! As I hesitated, two of the beautiful upperworld people c*** running in their amorous sport across the daylight in the shadow. The m*** pursued the female, flinging flowers at her as he ran. â\\x80\\x9cThey seemed distressed to f*** me, my arm against the overturned pillar, peering d*** the well. Apparently it was considered bad f*** to remark these apertures; for w*** I pointed to t*** o*** and tried to frame a question about it in their tongue, t*** w*** still m*** visibly distressed and turned away. But t*** w*** interested by my matches, and I struck s*** to amuse them. I tried t*** again about the well, and again I failed. So presently I l*** them, meaning to go b*** to Weena, and see w*** I could get f*** her. But my m*** was already in revolution; my guesses and impressions w*** slipping and sliding to a new adjustment. I had now a c*** to the import of these wells, to the ventilating towers, to the mystery of the ghosts; to say nothing of a h*** at the meaning of the bronze gates and the f*** of the T*** Machine! And v*** vaguely there c*** a suggestion towards the solution of the economic problem t*** had puzzled me. â\\x80\\x9cHere was the new view. Plainly, t*** second species of Man was subterranean. There w*** three circumstances in particular which m*** me think t*** its r*** emergence above ground was the outcome of a long-continued underground habit. In the first place, there was the bleached l*** common in m*** animals t*** l*** largely in the darkâ\\x80\\x94the white f*** of the Kentucky caves, for instance. Then, those large eyes, w*** t*** capacity for reflecting light, are common features of nocturnal thingsâ\\x80\\x94witness the owl and the cat. And l*** of a*** t*** evident confusion in the sunshine, t*** hasty yet fumbling awkward flight towards d*** shadow, and t*** peculiar carriage of the h*** while in the lightâ\\x80\\x94all reinforced the theory of an extreme sensitiveness of the retina. â\\x80\\x9cBeneath my feet, then, the earth m*** be tunnelled enormously, and these tunnellings w*** the habitat of the New Race. The presence of ventilating shafts and wells along the h*** slopesâ\\x80\\x94everywhere, in fact, except along the river valleyâ\\x80\\x94showed how universal w*** its ramifications. W*** so natural, then, as to assume t*** it was in t*** artificial Underworld t*** s*** w*** as was necessary to the comfort of the daylight r*** was done? The notion was so plausible t*** I at o*** accepted it, and w*** on to assume the _how_ of t*** splitting of the human species. I d*** say you w*** anticipate the shape of my theory; though, for myself, I v*** s*** f*** t*** it f*** far short of the truth. â\\x80\\x9cAt first, proceeding f*** the problems of our own a*** it seemed clear as daylight to me t*** the gradual widening of the present merely temporary and social difference between the Capitalist and the Labourer was the key to the whole position. No doubt it w*** s*** grotesque enough to youâ\\x80\\x94and wildly incredible!â\\x80\\x94and yet e*** now there are existing circumstances to point t*** way. There is a tendency to utilise underground space for the l*** ornamental purposes of civilisation; there is the Metropolitan Railway in London, for instance, there are new electric railways, there are subways, there are underground workrooms and restaurants, and t*** increase and multiply. Evidently, I thought, t*** tendency had increased t*** Industry had gradually l*** its birthright in the sky. I m*** t*** it had g*** deeper and deeper i*** larger and e*** larger underground factories, spending a still-increasing amount of its t*** therein, till, in the endâ\\x80\\x94! E*** n*** d*** not an East-end worker l*** in s*** artificial conditions as practically to be cut off f*** the natural surface of the earth? â\\x80\\x9cAgain, the exclusive tendency of richer peopleâ\\x80\\x94due, no doubt, to the increasing refinement of their education, and the widening g*** between t*** and the r*** violence of the poorâ\\x80\\x94is already leading to the closing, in their interest, of considerable portions of the surface of the land. About London, for instance, perhaps h*** the prettier country is s*** in against intrusion. And t*** s*** widening gulfâ\\x80\\x94which is due to the length and expense of the higher educational process and the increased facilities for and temptations towards refined habits on the p*** of the richâ\\x80\\x94will m*** t*** exchange between class and class, t*** promotion by intermarriage which at present retards the splitting of our species along lines of social stratification, l*** and l*** frequent. So, in the e*** above ground you m*** h*** the Haves, pursuing pleasure and comfort and beauty, and below ground the Have-nots, the Workers getting continually adapted to the conditions of their labour. O*** t*** w*** there, t*** would no doubt h*** to pay rent, and not a little of it, for the ventilation of their caverns; and if t*** refused, t*** would starve or be suffocated for arrears. S*** of t*** as w*** so constituted as to be miserable and rebellious would d*** a*** in the e*** the balance being permanent, the survivors would become as w*** adapted to the conditions of underground life, and as happy in their w*** as the Overworld people w*** to theirs. As it seemed to me, the refined beauty and the etiolated pallor followed naturally enough. â\\x80\\x9cThe great triumph of Humanity I had dreamed of t*** a different shape in my mind. It had b*** no s*** triumph of moral education and general co-operation as I had imagined. Instead, I saw a r*** aristocracy, armed w*** a perfected science and working to a logical conclusion the industrial system of today. Its triumph had not b*** simply a triumph o*** Nature, but a triumph o*** Nature and the fellow-man. This, I m*** w*** y*** was my theory at the time. I had no convenient cicerone in the pattern of the Utopian books. My explanation may be absolutely wrong. I still think it is the m*** plausible one. But e*** on t*** supposition the balanced civilisation t*** was at l*** attained m*** h*** l*** since passed its zenith, and was now far fallen i*** decay. The too-perfect security of the Overworlders had led t*** to a s*** movement of degeneration, to a general dwindling in size, strength, and intelligence. T*** I could see clearly enough already. W*** had happened to the Undergrounders I did not yet suspect; b*** f*** w*** I had s*** of the Morlocksâ\\x80\\x94that, by the b*** was the n*** by which these creatures w*** calledâ\\x80\\x94I could imagine t*** the modification of the human t*** was e*** far m*** profound t*** among the â\\x80\\x98Eloi,â\\x80\\x99 the beautiful r*** t*** I already knew. â\\x80\\x9cThen c*** troublesome doubts. Why had the Morlocks taken my T*** Machine? For I f*** s*** it was t*** who had taken it. W*** t*** if the E*** w*** masters, could t*** not restore the machine to me? And why w*** t*** so terribly afraid of the dark? I proceeded, as I h*** said, to question Weena about t*** Underworld, but h*** again I was disappointed. At first she would not understand my questions, and presently she refused to answer them. She shivered as though the topic was unendurable. And w*** I pressed h*** perhaps a little harshly, she burst i*** tears. T*** w*** the o*** tears, except my o*** I e*** saw in t*** Golden Age. W*** I saw t*** I ceased abruptly to trouble about the Morlocks, and was o*** concerned in banishing these signs of her human inheritance f*** Weenaâ\\x80\\x99s eyes. And v*** s*** she was smiling and clapping her hands, while I solemnly burnt a match. IX. The Morlocks â\\x80\\x9cIt may s*** odd to y*** but it was two d*** before I could follow up the new-found c*** in w*** was manifestly the proper way. I f*** a peculiar shrinking f*** those pallid bodies. T*** w*** j*** the half-bleached colour of the worms and things one s*** preserved in spirit in a zoological museum. And t*** w*** filthily c*** to the touch. Probably my shrinking was largely due to the sympathetic influence of the Eloi, whose disgust of the Morlocks I now began to appreciate. â\\x80\\x9cThe n*** night I did not sleep well. Probably my health was a little disordered. I was oppressed w*** perplexity and doubt. O*** or twice I had a feeling of intense f*** for which I could perceive no definite reason. I remember creeping noiselessly i*** the great h*** where the little people w*** sleeping in the moonlightâ\\x80\\x94that night Weena was among themâ\\x80\\x94and feeling reassured by their presence. It occurred to me e*** then, t*** in the course of a few d*** the m*** m*** p*** through its l*** quarter, and the nights g*** dark, w*** the appearances of these unpleasant creatures f*** below, these whitened Lemurs, t*** new vermin t*** had replaced the o*** might be m*** abundant. And on b*** these d*** I had the restless feeling of one who shirks an inevitable duty. I f*** assured t*** the T*** Machine was o*** to be recovered by boldly penetrating these mysteries of underground. Yet I could not f*** the mystery. If o*** I had had a companion it would h*** b*** different. But I was so horribly alone, and e*** to clamber d*** i*** the darkness of the w*** appalled me. I donâ\\x80\\x99t k*** if you w*** understand my feeling, but I never f*** quite s*** at my back. â\\x80\\x9cIt was t*** restlessness, t*** insecurity, perhaps, t*** drove me farther and farther afield in my exploring expeditions. Going to the south-westward towards the rising country t*** is now called Combe Wood, I observed far-off, in the direction of nineteenth-century Banstead, a v*** green structure, different in character f*** any I had hitherto seen. It was larger t*** the largest of the palaces or ruins I knew, and the faÃ§ade had an Oriental look: the f*** of it having the lustre, as w*** as the pale-green tint, a k*** of bluish-green, of a certain t*** of Chinese porcelain. T*** difference in aspect suggested a difference in u*** and I was minded to p*** on and explore. But the day was growing late, and I had c*** u*** the sight of the place after a l*** and tiring circuit; so I resolved to h*** o*** the adventure for the following d*** and I returned to the welcome and the caresses of little Weena. But n*** morning I perceived clearly enough t*** my curiosity regarding the Palace of Green Porcelain was a piece of self-deception, to enable me to shirk, by another d*** an experience I dreaded. I resolved I would m*** the descent without further waste of time, and started out in the early morning towards a w*** n*** the ruins of granite and aluminium. â\\x80\\x9cLittle Weena ran w*** me. She danced beside me to the well, but w*** she saw me l*** o*** the mouth and l*** downward, she seemed strangely disconcerted. â\\x80\\x98Good-bye, little Weena,â\\x80\\x99 I said, kissing h*** and t*** putting her down, I began to f*** o*** the parapet for the climbing hooks. Rather hastily, I may as w*** confess, for I feared my courage might l*** away! At first she watched me in amazement. T*** she g*** a m*** piteous c*** and running to me, she began to p*** at me w*** her little hands. I think her opposition nerved me rather to proceed. I shook her o*** perhaps a little roughly, and in another moment I was in the throat of the well. I saw her agonised f*** o*** the parapet, and smiled to reassure her. T*** I had to l*** d*** at the unstable hooks to which I clung. â*** had to clamber d*** a shaft of perhaps two hundred yards. The descent was effected by means of metallic b*** projecting f*** the sides of the well, and these being adapted to the needs of a creature m*** smaller and lighter t*** myself, I was speedily cramped and fatigued by the descent. And not simply fatigued! One of the b*** b*** suddenly under my weight, and almost swung me off i*** the blackness beneath. For a moment I h*** by one hand, and after t*** experience I did not d*** to r*** again. Though my a*** and b*** w*** presently acutely painful, I w*** on clambering d*** the sheer descent w*** as quick a motion as possible. Glancing upward, I saw the aperture, a small b*** disc, in which a s*** was visible, while little Weenaâ\\x80\\x99s h*** showed as a round black projection. The thudding sound of a machine below g*** louder and m*** oppressive. Everything s*** t*** little d*** above was profoundly dark, and w*** I looked up again Weena had disappeared. â*** was in an agony of discomfort. I had s*** thought of trying to go up the shaft again, and leave the Underworld alone. But e*** while I turned t*** o*** in my m*** I continued to descend. At last, w*** intense relief, I saw dimly coming up, a f*** to the right of me, a slender loophole in the wall. Swinging myself in, I found it was the aperture of a narrow horizontal tunnel in which I could lie d*** and rest. It was not too soon. My a*** ached, my b*** was cramped, and I was trembling w*** the prolonged terror of a fall. Besides this, the unbroken darkness had had a distressing effect u*** my eyes. The air was f*** of the throb and hum of machinery pumping air d*** the shaft. â*** do not k*** how l*** I lay. I was arroused by a s*** h*** touching my face. Starting up in the darkness I snatched at my matches a*** hastily striking o*** I saw three stooping white creatures similar to the one I had s*** above ground in the ruin, hastily retreating before the light. Living, as t*** d*** in w*** appeared to me impenetrable darkness, their e*** w*** abnormally large and sensitive, j*** as are the pupils of the abysmal fishes, and t*** reflected the light in the s*** way. I h*** no doubt t*** could see me in t*** rayless obscurity, and t*** did not s*** to h*** any f*** of me apart f*** the light. B*** so s*** as I struck a match in order to see them, t*** f*** incontinently, vanishing i*** d*** gutters and tunnels, f*** which their e*** glared at me in the strangest fashion. â*** tried to c*** to them, but the language t*** had was apparently different f*** t*** of the Overworld people; so t*** I was needs l*** to my own unaided efforts, and the thought of flight before exploration was e*** t*** in my mind. But I s*** to myself, â\\x80\\x98You are in for it now,â\\x80\\x99 a*** feeling my way along the tunnel, I found the noise of machinery g*** louder. Presently the walls f*** a*** f*** me, and I c*** to a large o*** space, and striking another match, saw t*** I had entered a v*** arched cavern, which stretched i*** utter darkness beyond the range of my light. The v*** I had of it was as m*** as one could see in the burning of a match. â\\x80\\x9cNecessarily my memory is vague. Great shapes l*** big machines r*** out of the dimness, and c*** grotesque black shadows, in which dim spectral Morlocks sheltered f*** the glare. The place, by the b*** was v*** stuffy and oppressive, and the faint halitus of freshly-shed blood was in the air. S*** way d*** the central vista was a little table of white metal, l*** w*** w*** seemed a meal. The Morlocks at any r*** w*** carnivorous! E*** at the time, I remember wondering w*** large animal could h*** survived to furnish the red joint I saw. It was all v*** indistinct: the heavy smell, the big unmeaning shapes, the obscene figures lurking in the shadows, and o*** waiting for the darkness to c*** at me again! T*** the match burnt down, and stung my fingers, and fell, a wriggling red s*** in the blackness. â*** h*** thought since how particularly ill-equipped I was for s*** an experience. W*** I had started w*** the T*** Machine, I had started w*** the absurd assumption t*** the men of the Future would certainly be infinitely ahead of ourselves in all their appliances. I had c*** without arms, without medicine, without anything to smokeâ\\x80\\x94at times I missed tobacco frightfully!â\\x80\\x94even without enough matches. If o*** I had thought of a Kodak! I could h*** flashed t*** glimpse of the Underworld in a second, and examined it at leisure. B*** as it w*** I stood there w*** o*** the weapons and the powers t*** Nature had endowed me withâ\\x80\\x94hands, feet, and teeth; these, and f*** safety-matches t*** still remained to me. â*** was afraid to p*** my way in among all t*** machinery in the dark, and it was o*** w*** my l*** glimpse of light I discovered t*** my store of matches had run low. It had never occurred to me until t*** moment t*** there was any n*** to economise them, and I had wasted almost h*** the box in astonishing the Overworlders, to w*** f*** was a novelty. N*** as I s*** I had f*** left, and while I stood in the dark, a h*** touched mine, l*** fingers c*** feeling o*** my face, and I was sensible of a peculiar unpleasant odour. I fancied I heard the breathing of a crowd of those dreadful little beings about me. I f*** the box of matches in my h*** being gently disengaged, and other hands behind me plucking at my clothing. The sense of these unseen creatures examining me was indescribably unpleasant. The sudden realisation of my ignorance of their w*** of thinking and doing c*** h*** to me v*** vividly in the darkness. I shouted at t*** as loudly as I could. T*** started away, and t*** I could f*** t*** approaching me again. T*** clutched at me m*** boldly, whispering odd sounds to e*** other. I shivered violently, and shouted againâ\\x80\\x94rather discordantly. T*** t*** t*** w*** not so seriously alarmed, and t*** m*** a queer laughing noise as t*** c*** b*** at me. I w*** confess I was horribly frightened. I determined to strike another match and escape under the protection of its glare. I did so, and eking out the flicker w*** a scrap of paper f*** my pocket, I m*** g*** my retreat to the narrow tunnel. But I had scarce entered t*** w*** my light was blown out and in the blackness I could h*** the Morlocks rustling l*** w*** among leaves, and pattering l*** the rain, as t*** hurried after me. â\\x80\\x9cIn a moment I was clutched by several hands, and there was no mistaking t*** t*** w*** trying to h*** me back. I struck another light, and waved it in their dazzled faces. You can scarce imagine how nauseatingly inhuman t*** lookedâ\\x80\\x94those pale, chinless faces and great, lidless, pinkish-grey eyes!â\\x80\\x94as t*** stared in their blindness and bewilderment. But I did not s*** to look, I promise y*** I retreated again, and w*** my second match had ended, I struck my third. It had almost burnt through w*** I reached the opening i*** the shaft. I lay d*** on the edge, for the throb of the great p*** below m*** me giddy. T*** I f*** sideways for the projecting hooks, a*** as I did so, my f*** w*** grasped f*** behind, and I was violently tugged backward. I lit my l*** match â\\x80¦ and it incontinently w*** out. But I had my h*** on the climbing b*** n*** a*** kicking violently, I disengaged myself f*** the clutches of the Morlocks, and was speedily clambering up the shaft, while t*** stayed peering and blinking up at me: all but one little wretch who followed me for s*** w*** and well-nigh secured my b*** as a trophy. â\\x80\\x9cThat climb seemed interminable to me. W*** the l*** twenty or thirty f*** of it a deadly nausea c*** u*** me. I had the greatest difficulty in keeping my hold. The l*** few yards was a frightful struggle against t*** faintness. Several times my h*** swam, and I f*** all the sensations of falling. At last, however, I got o*** the well-mouth somehow, and staggered out of the r*** i*** the blinding sunlight. I f*** u*** my face. E*** the s*** smelt sweet and clean. T*** I remember Weena kissing my hands and ears, and the voices of others among the Eloi. Then, for a time, I was insensible. X. W*** Night C*** â\\x80\\x9cNow, indeed, I seemed in a worse c*** t*** before. Hitherto, except during my nightâ\\x80\\x99s anguish at the l*** of the T*** Machine, I had f*** a sustaining h*** of ultimate escape, but t*** h*** was staggered by these new discoveries. Hitherto I had merely thought myself impeded by the childish simplicity of the little people, and by s*** unknown forces which I had o*** to understand to overcome; but there was an altogether new element in the sickening quality of the Morlocksâ\\x80\\x94a something inhuman and malign. Instinctively I loathed them. Before, I had f*** as a man might f*** who had fallen i*** a p*** my concern was w*** the pit and how to get out of it. Now I f*** l*** a beast in a trap, whose enemy would c*** u*** him soon. â\\x80\\x9cThe enemy I dreaded may surprise you. It was the darkness of the new moon. Weena had put t*** i*** my h*** by s*** at first incomprehensible remarks about the D*** Nights. It was not now s*** a v*** difficult problem to guess w*** the coming D*** Nights might mean. The m*** was on the wane: e*** night there was a longer interval of darkness. And I now understood to s*** slight degree at least the reason of the f*** of the little Upperworld people for the dark. I wondered vaguely w*** f*** villainy it might be t*** the Morlocks did under the new moon. I f*** pretty s*** now t*** my second hypothesis was all wrong. The Upperworld people might o*** h*** b*** the favoured aristocracy, and the Morlocks their mechanical servants: but t*** had l*** since passed away. The two species t*** had resulted f*** the evolution of man w*** sliding d*** towards, or had already arrived at, an altogether new relationship. The Eloi, l*** the Carlovignan kings, had decayed to a m*** beautiful futility. T*** still possessed the earth on sufferance: since the Morlocks, subterranean for innumerable generations, had c*** at l*** to f*** the daylit surface intolerable. And the Morlocks m*** their garments, I inferred, and maintained t*** in their habitual needs, perhaps through the survival of an old habit of service. T*** did it as a standing horse p*** w*** his foot, or as a man enjoys killing animals in sport: because ancient and departed necessities had impressed it on the organism. B*** clearly, the old order was already in p*** reversed. The Nemesis of the delicate o*** was creeping on apace. A*** a*** thousands of generations a*** man had thrust his brother man out of the e*** and the sunshine. And now t*** brother was coming backâ\\x80\\x94changed! Already the E*** had begun to learn one old lesson anew. T*** w*** becoming reacquainted w*** Fear. And suddenly there c*** i*** my h*** the memory of the m*** I had s*** in the Underworld. It seemed odd how it floated i*** my mind: not stirred up as it w*** by the current of my meditations, but coming in almost l*** a question f*** outside. I tried to recall the f*** of it. I had a vague sense of something familiar, but I could not t*** w*** it was at the time. â\\x80\\x9cStill, however helpless the little people in the presence of their mysterious Fear, I was differently constituted. I c*** out of t*** age of ours, t*** r*** prime of the human race, w*** F*** d*** not paralyse and mystery has l*** its terrors. I at least would defend myself. Without further delay I determined to m*** myself a*** and a fastness where I might sleep. W*** t*** refuge as a base, I could f*** t*** strange world w*** s*** of t*** confidence I had l*** in realising to w*** creatures night by night I lay exposed. I f*** I could never sleep again until my bed was secure f*** them. I shuddered w*** horror to think how t*** m*** already h*** examined me. â*** wandered during the afternoon along the valley of the Thames, but found nothing t*** commended itself to my m*** as inaccessible. All the buildings and trees seemed easily practicable to s*** dexterous climbers as the Morlocks, to judge by their wells, m*** be. T*** the t*** pinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain and the polished gleam of its walls c*** b*** to my memory; and in the evening, taking Weena l*** a child u*** my shoulder, I w*** up the hills towards the south-west. The distance, I had reckoned, was seven or eight miles, but it m*** h*** b*** nearer eighteen. I had first s*** the place on a moist afternoon w*** distances are deceptively diminished. In addition, the h*** of one of my shoes was loose, and a n*** was working through the soleâ\\x80\\x94they w*** comfortable old shoes I w*** about indoorsâ\\x80\\x94so t*** I was lame. And it was already l*** p*** sunset w*** I c*** in sight of the palace, silhouetted black against the p*** yellow of the sky. â\\x80\\x9cWeena had b*** hugely delighted w*** I began to carry h*** but after a while she desired me to let her down, and ran along by the s*** of me, occasionally darting off on either h*** to p*** flowers to stick in my pockets. My pockets had always puzzled Weena, but at the l*** she had concluded t*** t*** w*** an eccentric k*** of vases for floral decoration. At least she utilised t*** for t*** purpose. And t*** reminds me! In changing my jacket I foundâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d _*** T*** Traveller paused, put his h*** i*** his pocket, and silently placed two withered flowers, not unlike v*** large white mallows, u*** the little table. T*** he resumed his narrative._ â\\x80\\x9cAs the h*** of evening crept o*** the world and we proceeded o*** the h*** crest towards Wimbledon, Weena g*** tired and wanted to return to the house of g*** stone. But I pointed out the distant pinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain to h*** and contrived to m*** her understand t*** we w*** seeking a refuge there f*** her Fear. You k*** t*** great pause t*** comes u*** things before the dusk? E*** the breeze stops in the trees. To me there is always an air of expectation about t*** evening stillness. The sky was clear, remote, and empty s*** for a few horizontal b*** far d*** in the sunset. Well, t*** night the expectation t*** the colour of my fears. In t*** darkling c*** my senses seemed preternaturally sharpened. I fancied I could e*** f*** the hollowness of the ground beneath my feet: could, indeed, almost see through it the Morlocks on their ant-hill going hither and thither and waiting for the dark. In my excitement I fancied t*** t*** would receive my invasion of their burrows as a declaration of war. And why had t*** taken my T*** Machine? â\\x80\\x9cSo we w*** on in the quiet, and the twilight deepened i*** night. The clear b*** of the distance faded, and one s*** after another c*** out. The ground g*** dim and the trees black. Weenaâ\\x80\\x99s fears and her fatigue g*** u*** her. I t*** her in my a*** and talked to her and caressed her. Then, as the darkness g*** deeper, she put her a*** round my neck, a*** closing her eyes, tightly pressed her f*** against my shoulder. So we w*** d*** a l*** slope i*** a valley, and there in the dimness I almost walked i*** a little river. T*** I waded, and w*** up the opposite s*** of the valley, p*** a number of sleeping houses, and by a statueâ\\x80\\x94a Faun, or s*** s*** figure, _minus_ the head. H*** too w*** acacias. So far I had s*** nothing of the Morlocks, but it was yet early in the night, and the darker hours before the old m*** r*** w*** still to come. â\\x80\\x9cFrom the b*** of the n*** h*** I saw a thick w*** spreading w*** and black before me. I hesitated at this. I could see no end to it, either to the right or the left. Feeling tiredâ\\x80\\x94my feet, in particular, w*** v*** soreâ\\x80\\x94I carefully lowered Weena f*** my shoulder as I halted, and sat d*** u*** the turf. I could no longer see the Palace of Green Porcelain, and I was in doubt of my direction. I looked i*** the thickness of the w*** and thought of w*** it might hide. Under t*** dense tangle of branches one would be out of sight of the stars. E*** w*** there no other lurking dangerâ\\x80\\x94a danger I did not c*** to let my imagination loose uponâ\\x80\\x94there would still be all the roots to stumble o*** and the tree-boles to strike against. I was v*** tired, t*** after the excitements of the d*** so I decided t*** I would not f*** it, but would p*** the night u*** the o*** hill. â\\x80\\x9cWeena, I was g*** to find, was f*** asleep. I carefully wrapped her in my jacket, and sat d*** beside her to w*** for the moonrise. The hillside was quiet and deserted, but f*** the black of the w*** there c*** now and t*** a s*** of living things. Above me shone the stars, for the night was v*** clear. I f*** a certain sense of friendly comfort in their twinkling. All the old constellations had g*** f*** the s*** however: t*** s*** movement which is imperceptible in a hundred human lifetimes, had l*** since rearranged t*** in unfamiliar groupings. But the Milky W*** it seemed to me, was still the s*** tattered streamer of star-dust as of yore. Southward (as I judged it) was a v*** bright red s*** t*** was new to me; it was e*** m*** splendid t*** our own green Sirius. And a*** all these scintillating points of light one bright planet shone kindly and steadily l*** the f*** of an old friend. â\\x80\\x9cLooking at these stars suddenly dwarfed my own troubles and all the gravities of terrestrial life. I thought of their unfathomable distance, and the s*** inevitable drift of their movements out of the unknown p*** i*** the unknown future. I thought of the great precessional cycle t*** the p*** of the earth describes. O*** forty times had t*** silent revolution occurred during all the years t*** I had traversed. And during these few revolutions all the activity, all the traditions, the complex organisations, the nations, languages, literatures, aspirations, e*** the m*** memory of Man as I k*** h*** had b*** swept out of existence. Instead w*** these frail creatures who had forgotten their h*** ancestry, and the white Things of which I w*** in terror. T*** I thought of the Great F*** t*** was between the two species, and for the first time, w*** a sudden shiver, c*** the clear knowledge of w*** the m*** I had s*** might be. Yet it was too horrible! I looked at little Weena sleeping beside me, her f*** white and starlike under the stars, and forthwith dismissed the thought. â\\x80\\x9cThrough t*** l*** night I h*** my m*** off the Morlocks as w*** as I could, and whiled a*** the t*** by trying to fancy I could f*** signs of the old constellations in the new confusion. The sky k*** v*** clear, except for a h*** cloud or so. No doubt I dozed at times. Then, as my vigil w*** on, c*** a faintness in the eastward s*** l*** the reflection of s*** colourless fire, and the old m*** rose, t*** and peaked and white. And close behind, and overtaking it, and overflowing it, the d*** came, p*** at first, and t*** growing p*** and warm. No Morlocks had approached us. Indeed, I had s*** n*** u*** the h*** t*** night. And in the confidence of renewed day it almost seemed to me t*** my f*** had b*** unreasonable. I stood up and found my f*** w*** the loose h*** swollen at the ankle and painful under the heel; so I sat d*** again, t*** off my shoes, and flung t*** away. â*** awakened Weena, and we w*** d*** i*** the wood, now green and pleasant instead of black and forbidding. We found s*** fruit wherewith to break our fast. We s*** met others of the dainty ones, laughing and dancing in the sunlight as though there was no s*** thing in nature as the night. And t*** I thought o*** m*** of the m*** t*** I had seen. I f*** assured now of w*** it w*** and f*** the bottom of my heart I pitied t*** l*** feeble r*** f*** the great flood of humanity. Clearly, at s*** t*** in the Long-Ago of human decay the Morlocksâ\\x80\\x99 f*** had run short. Possibly t*** had lived on r*** and such-like vermin. E*** now man is far l*** discriminating and exclusive in his f*** t*** he wasâ\\x80\\x94far l*** t*** any monkey. His prejudice against human flesh is no deep-seated instinct. And so these inhuman s*** of menâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94! I tried to l*** at the thing in a scientific spirit. After a*** t*** w*** l*** human and m*** remote t*** our cannibal ancestors of three or f*** thousand years ago. And the intelligence t*** would h*** m*** t*** state of things a torment had gone. Why should I trouble myself? These E*** w*** m*** fatted cattle, which the ant-like Morlocks preserved and preyed uponâ\\x80\\x94probably saw to the breeding of. And there was Weena dancing at my side! â\\x80\\x9cThen I tried to preserve myself f*** the horror t*** was coming u*** me, by regarding it as a rigorous punishment of human selfishness. Man had b*** content to l*** in e*** and delight u*** the labours of his fellow-man, had taken Necessity as his watchword and excuse, and in the fullness of t*** Necessity had c*** h*** to him. I e*** tried a Carlyle-like scorn of t*** wretched aristocracy in decay. But t*** attitude of m*** was impossible. However great their intellectual degradation, the E*** had k*** too m*** of the human f*** not to claim my sympathy, and to m*** me perforce a sharer in their degradation and their Fear. â*** had at t*** t*** v*** vague ideas as to the course I should pursue. My first was to secure s*** s*** place of refuge, and to m*** myself s*** a*** of metal or stone as I could contrive. T*** necessity was immediate. In the n*** place, I hoped to procure s*** means of fire, so t*** I should h*** the weapon of a torch at hand, for nothing, I knew, would be m*** efficient against these Morlocks. T*** I wanted to arrange s*** contrivance to break o*** the doors of bronze under the White Sphinx. I had in m*** a battering ram. I had a persuasion t*** if I could enter those doors and carry a blaze of light before me I should discover the T*** Machine and escape. I could not imagine the Morlocks w*** strong enough to m*** it far away. Weena I had resolved to bring w*** me to our own time. And turning s*** schemes o*** in my m*** I pursued our way towards the building which my fancy had chosen as our dwelling. XI. The Palace of Green Porcelain â*** found the Palace of Green Porcelain, w*** we approached it about noon, deserted and falling i*** ruin. O*** ragged vestiges of glass remained in its windows, and great sheets of the green facing had fallen a*** f*** the corroded metallic framework. It lay v*** h*** u*** a turfy down, and looking north-eastward before I entered it, I was surprised to see a large estuary, or e*** creek, where I judged Wandsworth and Battersea m*** o*** h*** been. I thought thenâ\\x80\\x94though I never followed up the thoughtâ\\x80\\x94of w*** might h*** happened, or might be happening, to the living things in the sea. â\\x80\\x9cThe material of the Palace proved on examination to be indeed porcelain, and along the f*** of it I saw an inscription in s*** unknown character. I thought, rather foolishly, t*** Weena might h*** me to interpret this, but I o*** learnt t*** the b*** i*** of writing had never entered her head. She always seemed to me, I fancy, m*** human t*** she w*** perhaps because her affection was so human. â\\x80\\x9cWithin the big valves of the doorâ\\x80\\x94which w*** o*** and brokenâ\\x80\\x94we found, instead of the customary hall, a l*** gallery lit by m*** s*** windows. At the first glance I was reminded of a museum. The tiled floor was thick w*** dust, and a remarkable array of miscellaneous objects was shrouded in the s*** g*** covering. T*** I perceived, standing strange and gaunt in the centre of the hall, w*** was clearly the lower p*** of a h*** skeleton. I recognised by the oblique f*** t*** it was s*** extinct creature after the fashion of the Megatherium. The skull and the upper bones lay beside it in the thick dust, and in one place, where rain-water had dropped through a l*** in the roof, the thing itself had b*** w*** away. Further in the gallery was the h*** skeleton barrel of a Brontosaurus. My museum hypothesis was confirmed. Going towards the s*** I found w*** appeared to be sloping shelves, and clearing a*** the thick dust, I found the old familiar glass cases of our own time. But t*** m*** h*** b*** air-tight to judge f*** the f*** preservation of s*** of their contents. â\\x80\\x9cClearly we stood among the ruins of s*** latter-day South Kensington! Here, apparently, was the PalÃ¦ontological Section, and a v*** splendid array of fossils it m*** h*** been, though the inevitable process of decay t*** had b*** staved off for a time, and h*** through the extinction of bacteria and fungi, l*** ninety-nine hundredths of its force, was nevertheless, w*** extreme sureness if w*** extreme slowness at w*** again u*** all its treasures. H*** and there I found traces of the little people in the shape of r*** fossils broken to pieces or threaded in strings u*** reeds. And the cases had in s*** instances b*** bodily removedâ\\x80\\x94by the Morlocks, as I judged. The place was v*** silent. The thick d*** deadened our footsteps. Weena, who had b*** rolling a sea urchin d*** the sloping glass of a case, presently came, as I stared about me, and v*** quietly t*** my h*** and stood beside me. â\\x80\\x9cAnd at first I was so m*** surprised by t*** ancient monument of an intellectual age t*** I g*** no thought to the possibilities it presented. E*** my preoccupation about the T*** Machine receded a little f*** my mind. â\\x80\\x9cTo judge f*** the s*** of the place, t*** Palace of Green Porcelain had a great d*** m*** in it t*** a Gallery of PalÃ¦ontology; possibly historical galleries; it might be, e*** a library! To me, at least in my present circumstances, these would be vastly m*** interesting t*** t*** spectacle of old-time geology in decay. Exploring, I found another short gallery running transversely to the first. T*** appeared to be devoted to minerals, and the sight of a block of sulphur set my m*** running on gunpowder. But I could f*** no saltpetre; indeed, no nitrates of any kind. Doubtless t*** had deliquesced a*** ago. Yet the sulphur h*** in my mind, and set up a train of thinking. As for the r*** of the contents of t*** gallery, though on the whole t*** w*** the b*** preserved of all I s*** I had little interest. I am no specialist in mineralogy, and I w*** on d*** a v*** ruinous aisle running parallel to the first h*** I had entered. Apparently t*** section had b*** devoted to natural history, but everything had l*** since passed out of recognition. A few shrivelled and blackened vestiges of w*** had o*** b*** stuffed animals, desiccated mummies in j*** t*** had o*** h*** spirit, a brown d*** of departed plants: t*** was a*** I was sorry for that, because I should h*** b*** g*** to trace the patient readjustments by which the conquest of animated nature had b*** attained. T*** we c*** to a gallery of simply colossal proportions, but singularly ill-lit, the floor of it running downward at a slight angle f*** the end at which I entered. At intervals white globes h*** f*** the ceilingâ\\x80\\x94many of t*** cracked and smashedâ\\x80\\x94which suggested t*** originally the place had b*** artificially lit. H*** I was m*** in my element, for rising on either s*** of me w*** the h*** bulks of big machines, all greatly corroded and m*** broken down, but s*** still fairly complete. You k*** I h*** a certain weakness for mechanism, and I was inclined to linger among these; the m*** so as for the m*** p*** t*** had the interest of puzzles, and I could m*** o*** the vaguest guesses at w*** t*** w*** for. I fancied t*** if I could solve their puzzles I should f*** myself in possession of powers t*** might be of use against the Morlocks. â\\x80\\x9cSuddenly Weena c*** v*** close to my side. So suddenly t*** she startled me. Had it not b*** for her I do not think I should h*** noticed t*** the floor of the gallery sloped at all. [Footnote: It may be, of course, t*** the floor did not slope, but t*** the museum was built i*** the s*** of a hill.â\\x80\\x94ED.] The end I had c*** in at was quite above ground, and was lit by r*** slit-like windows. As you w*** d*** the length, the ground c*** up against these windows, until at l*** there was a pit l*** the â\\x80\\x98areaâ\\x80\\x98 of a London house before each, and o*** a narrow l*** of daylight at the top. I w*** slowly along, puzzling about the machines, and had b*** too intent u*** t*** to notice the gradual diminution of the light, until Weenaâ\\x80\\x99s increasing apprehensions d*** my attention. T*** I saw t*** the gallery ran d*** at l*** i*** a thick darkness. I hesitated, and then, as I looked round me, I saw t*** the d*** was l*** abundant and its surface l*** even. Further a*** towards the dimness, it appeared to be broken by a number of small narrow footprints. My sense of the immediate presence of the Morlocks revived at that. I f*** t*** I was wasting my t*** in the academic examination of machinery. I called to m*** t*** it was already far advanced in the afternoon, and t*** I had still no weapon, no refuge, and no means of making a fire. And t*** d*** in the remote blackness of the gallery I heard a peculiar pattering, and the s*** odd noises I had heard d*** the well. â*** t*** Weenaâ\\x80\\x99s hand. Then, struck w*** a sudden idea, I l*** her and turned to a machine f*** which projected a lever not unlike those in a signal-box. Clambering u*** the stand, and grasping t*** lever in my hands, I put all my weight u*** it sideways. Suddenly Weena, deserted in the central aisle, began to whimper. I had judged the strength of the lever pretty correctly, for it snapped after a minuteâ\\x80\\x99s strain, and I rejoined her w*** a m*** in my h*** m*** t*** sufficient, I judged, for any Morlock skull I might encounter. And I longed v*** m*** to k*** a Morlock or so. V*** inhuman, you may think, to w*** to go killing oneâ\\x80\\x99s own descendants! But it was impossible, somehow, to f*** any humanity in the things. O*** my disinclination to leave Weena, and a persuasion t*** if I began to slake my thirst for murder my T*** Machine might suffer, restrained me f*** going straight d*** the gallery and killing the brutes I heard. â\\x80\\x9cWell, m*** in one h*** and Weena in the other, I w*** out of t*** gallery and i*** another and still larger o*** which at the first glance reminded me of a military chapel h*** w*** tattered flags. The brown and charred r*** t*** h*** f*** the sides of it, I presently recognised as the decaying vestiges of books. T*** had l*** since dropped to pieces, and every semblance of print had l*** them. But h*** and there w*** warped boards and cracked metallic clasps t*** t*** the t*** w*** enough. Had I b*** a literary man I might, perhaps, h*** moralised u*** the futility of all ambition. But as it w*** the thing t*** struck me w*** keenest force was the enormous waste of labour to which t*** sombre wilderness of rotting paper testified. At the t*** I w*** confess t*** I thought chiefly of the _Philosophical Transactions_ and my own seventeen papers u*** physical optics. â\\x80\\x9cThen, going up a broad staircase, we c*** to w*** may o*** h*** b*** a gallery of technical chemistry. And h*** I had not a little h*** of useful discoveries. Except at one end where the r*** had collapsed, t*** gallery was w*** preserved. I w*** eagerly to every unbroken case. And at last, in one of the really air-tight cases, I found a box of matches. V*** eagerly I tried them. T*** w*** perfectly good. T*** w*** not e*** damp. I turned to Weena. â\\x80\\x98Dance,â\\x80\\x99 I cried to her in her own tongue. For now I had a weapon indeed against the horrible creatures we feared. And so, in t*** derelict museum, u*** the thick s*** carpeting of dust, to Weenaâ\\x80\\x99s h*** delight, I solemnly performed a k*** of composite dance, whistling _*** L*** of the Leal_ as cheerfully as I could. In p*** it was a modest _cancan_, in p*** a s*** dance, in p*** a skirt dance (so far as my tail-coat permitted), and in p*** original. For I am naturally inventive, as you know. â\\x80\\x9cNow, I still think t*** for t*** box of matches to h*** escaped the w*** of t*** for immemorial years was a m*** strange, as for me it was a m*** fortunate, thing. Y*** oddly enough, I found a far unlikelier substance, and t*** was camphor. I found it in a sealed j*** t*** by chance, I suppose, had b*** really hermetically sealed. I fancied at first t*** it was paraffin w*** and smashed the glass accordingly. But the odour of camphor was unmistakable. In the universal decay t*** volatile substance had chanced to survive, perhaps through m*** thousands of centuries. It reminded me of a sepia painting I had o*** s*** d*** f*** the ink of a fossil Belemnite t*** m*** h*** perished and become fossilised millions of years ago. I was about to throw it away, but I remembered t*** it was inflammable and burnt w*** a g*** bright flameâ\\x80\\x94was, in fact, an excellent candleâ\\x80\\x94and I put it in my pocket. I found no explosives, however, nor any means of breaking d*** the bronze doors. As yet my i*** crowbar was the m*** helpful thing I had chanced upon. Nevertheless I l*** t*** gallery greatly elated. â*** cannot t*** you all the story of t*** l*** afternoon. It would require a great effort of memory to recall my explorations in at all the proper order. I remember a l*** gallery of rusting stands of arms, and how I hesitated between my crowbar and a hatchet or a sword. I could not carry both, however, and my bar of i*** promised b*** against the bronze gates. There w*** numbers of guns, pistols, and rifles. The m*** w*** masses of rust, but m*** w*** of s*** new metal, and still fairly sound. But any cartridges or powder there may o*** h*** b*** had rotted i*** dust. One corner I saw was charred and shattered; perhaps, I thought, by an explosion among the specimens. In another place was a v*** array of idolsâ\\x80\\x94Polynesian, Mexican, Grecian, PhÅ\\x93nician, every country on earth, I should think. And here, yielding to an irresistible impulse, I wrote my n*** u*** the n*** of a steatite monster f*** South America t*** particularly t*** my fancy. â\\x80\\x9cAs the evening d*** on, my interest waned. I w*** through gallery after gallery, dusty, silent, often ruinous, the exhibits sometimes m*** heaps of r*** and lignite, sometimes fresher. In one place I suddenly found myself n*** the model of a tin mine, and t*** by the merest accident I discovered, in an air-tight case, two dynamite cartridges! I shouted â\\x80\\x98Eureka!â\\x80\\x99 and smashed the c*** w*** joy. T*** c*** a doubt. I hesitated. Then, selecting a little s*** gallery, I m*** my essay. I never f*** s*** a disappointment as I did in waiting five, t*** fifteen minutes for an explosion t*** never came. Of course the things w*** dummies, as I might h*** guessed f*** their presence. I really believe t*** had t*** not b*** so, I should h*** rushed off incontinently and blown Sphinx, bronze doors, and (as it proved) my chances of finding the T*** Machine, all together i*** non-existence. â\\x80\\x9cIt was after that, I think, t*** we c*** to a little o*** court within the palace. It was turfed, and had three fruit-trees. So we rested and refreshed ourselves. Towards sunset I began to consider our position. Night was creeping u*** us, and my inaccessible hiding-place had still to be found. But t*** troubled me v*** little now. I had in my possession a thing t*** w*** perhaps, the b*** of all defences against the Morlocksâ\\x80\\x94I had matches! I had the camphor in my pocket, t*** if a blaze w*** needed. It seemed to me t*** the b*** thing we could do would be to p*** the night in the open, protected by a fire. In the morning there was the getting of the T*** Machine. Towards that, as y*** I had o*** my i*** mace. But n*** w*** my growing knowledge, I f*** v*** differently towards those bronze doors. Up to this, I had refrained f*** forcing them, largely because of the mystery on the other side. T*** had never impressed me as being v*** strong, and I hoped to f*** my bar of i*** not altogether inadequate for the work. XII. In the Darkness â\\x80\\x9cWe emerged f*** the Palace while the sun was still in p*** above the horizon. I was determined to reach the White Sphinx early the n*** morning, and ere the d*** I purposed pushing through the woods t*** had stopped me on the previous journey. My p*** was to go as far as possible t*** night, and then, building a fire, to sleep in the protection of its glare. Accordingly, as we w*** along I gathered any sticks or dried grass I s*** and presently had my a*** f*** of s*** litter. T*** loaded, our progress was slower t*** I had anticipated, and besides Weena was tired. And I, also, began to suffer f*** sleepiness t*** so t*** it was f*** night before we reached the wood. U*** the shrubby h*** of its e*** Weena would h*** stopped, fearing the darkness before us; but a singular sense of impending calamity, t*** should indeed h*** served me as a warning, drove me onward. I had b*** without sleep for a night and two days, and I was feverish and irritable. I f*** sleep coming u*** me, and the Morlocks w*** it. â\\x80\\x9cWhile we hesitated, among the black bushes behind us, and dim against their blackness, I saw three crouching figures. There was scrub and l*** grass all about us, and I did not f*** s*** f*** their insidious approach. The forest, I calculated, was rather l*** t*** a m*** across. If we could get through it to the b*** hillside, there, as it seemed to me, was an altogether safer resting-place; I thought t*** w*** my matches and my camphor I could contrive to k*** my p*** illuminated through the woods. Yet it was evident t*** if I was to flourish matches w*** my hands I should h*** to abandon my firewood; so, rather reluctantly, I put it down. And t*** it c*** i*** my h*** t*** I would amaze our friends behind by lighting it. I was to discover the atrocious folly of t*** proceeding, but it c*** to my m*** as an ingenious m*** for covering our retreat. â*** donâ\\x80\\x99t k*** if you h*** e*** thought w*** a r*** thing flame m*** be in the absence of man and in a temperate climate. The sunâ\\x80\\x99s h*** is rarely strong enough to burn, e*** w*** it is focused by dewdrops, as is sometimes the c*** in m*** tropical districts. Lightning may blast and blacken, but it rarely gives r*** to widespread fire. Decaying vegetation may occasionally smoulder w*** the h*** of its fermentation, but t*** rarely results in flame. In t*** decadence, t*** the art of fire-making had b*** forgotten on the earth. The red tongues t*** w*** licking up my h*** of w*** w*** an altogether new and strange thing to Weena. â\\x80\\x9cShe wanted to run to it and p*** w*** it. I believe she would h*** c*** herself i*** it had I not restrained her. But I caught her up, and in spite of her struggles, plunged boldly before me i*** the wood. For a little way the glare of my f*** lit the path. Looking b*** presently, I could s*** through the crowded stems, t*** f*** my h*** of sticks the blaze had spread to s*** bushes adjacent, and a curved l*** of f*** was creeping up the grass of the hill. I laughed at that, and turned again to the d*** trees before me. It was v*** black, and Weena clung to me convulsively, but there was still, as my e*** g*** accustomed to the darkness, sufficient light for me to avoid the stems. Overhead it was simply black, except where a gap of remote b*** sky shone d*** u*** us h*** and there. I lit n*** of my matches because I had no h*** free. U*** my l*** arm I carried my little o*** in my right h*** I had my i*** bar. â\\x80\\x9cFor s*** way I heard nothing but the crackling twigs under my feet, the faint rustle of the breeze above, and my own breathing and the throb of the blood-vessels in my ears. T*** I seemed to k*** of a pattering behind me. I pushed on grimly. The pattering g*** m*** distinct, and t*** I caught the s*** queer sound and voices I had heard in the Underworld. There w*** evidently several of the Morlocks, and t*** w*** closing in u*** me. Indeed, in another minute I f*** a tug at my coat, t*** something at my arm. And Weena shivered violently, and became quite still. â\\x80\\x9cIt was t*** for a match. But to get one I m*** put her down. I did so, a*** as I fumbled w*** my pocket, a struggle began in the darkness about my knees, perfectly silent on her p*** and w*** the s*** peculiar cooing sounds f*** the Morlocks. S*** little hands, t*** w*** creeping o*** my c*** and back, touching e*** my neck. T*** the match scratched and fizzed. I h*** it flaring, and saw the white backs of the Morlocks in flight a*** the trees. I hastily t*** a l*** of camphor f*** my pocket, and prepared to light it as s*** as the match should wane. T*** I looked at Weena. She was lying clutching my f*** and quite motionless, w*** her f*** to the ground. W*** a sudden fright I stooped to her. She seemed scarcely to breathe. I lit the block of camphor and flung it to the ground, and as it split and flared up and drove b*** the Morlocks and the shadows, I knelt d*** and lifted her. The w*** behind seemed f*** of the s*** and murmur of a great company! â\\x80\\x9cShe seemed to h*** fainted. I put her carefully u*** my shoulder and r*** to p*** on, and t*** there c*** a horrible realisation. In manÅ\\x93uvring w*** my matches and Weena, I had turned myself about several times, and now I had not the faintest i*** in w*** direction lay my path. For all I knew, I might be facing b*** towards the Palace of Green Porcelain. I found myself in a c*** sweat. I had to think rapidly w*** to do. I determined to build a f*** and encamp where we were. I put Weena, still motionless, d*** u*** a turfy bole, and v*** hastily, as my first l*** of camphor waned, I began collecting sticks and leaves. H*** and there out of the darkness round me the Morlocksâ\\x80\\x99 e*** shone l*** carbuncles. â\\x80\\x9cThe camphor flickered and w*** out. I lit a match, and as I did so, two white forms t*** had b*** approaching Weena dashed hastily away. One was so blinded by the light t*** he c*** straight for me, and I f*** his bones grind under the b*** of my fist. He g*** a whoop of dismay, staggered a little w*** and f*** down. I lit another piece of camphor, and w*** on gathering my bonfire. Presently I noticed how dry was s*** of the foliage above me, for since my arrival on the T*** Machine, a matter of a week, no r*** had fallen. So, instead of casting about among the trees for fallen twigs, I began leaping up and dragging d*** branches. V*** s*** I had a choking smoky f*** of green w*** and dry sticks, and could economise my camphor. T*** I turned to where Weena lay beside my i*** mace. I tried w*** I could to revive h*** but she lay l*** one dead. I could not e*** satisfy myself whether or not she breathed. â\\x80\\x9cNow, the smoke of the f*** b*** o*** towards me, and it m*** h*** m*** me heavy of a sudden. Moreover, the vapour of camphor was in the air. My f*** would not n*** replenishing for an h*** or so. I f*** v*** weary after my exertion, and sat down. The wood, t*** was f*** of a slumbrous murmur t*** I did not understand. I seemed j*** to nod and o*** my eyes. But all was dark, and the Morlocks had their hands u*** me. Flinging off their clinging fingers I hastily f*** in my pocket for the match-box, andâ\\x80\\x94it had gone! T*** t*** gripped and closed w*** me again. In a moment I k*** w*** had happened. I had slept, and my f*** had g*** o*** and the bitterness of death c*** o*** my soul. The forest seemed f*** of the smell of burning wood. I was caught by the neck, by the hair, by the arms, and pulled down. It was indescribably horrible in the darkness to f*** all these s*** creatures heaped u*** me. I f*** as if I was in a monstrous spiderâ\\x80\\x99s web. I was overpowered, and w*** down. I f*** little teeth nipping at my neck. I rolled over, and as I did so my h*** c*** against my i*** lever. It g*** me strength. I struggled up, shaking the human r*** f*** me, a*** holding the bar short, I thrust where I judged their faces might be. I could f*** the succulent giving of flesh and b*** under my blows, and for a moment I was free. â\\x80\\x9cThe strange exultation t*** so often seems to accompany h*** fighting c*** u*** me. I k*** t*** b*** I and Weena w*** lost, but I determined to m*** the Morlocks pay for their meat. I stood w*** my b*** to a tree, swinging the i*** bar before me. The whole w*** was f*** of the s*** and cries of them. A minute passed. Their voices seemed to r*** to a higher pitch of excitement, and their movements g*** faster. Yet n*** c*** within reach. I stood glaring at the blackness. T*** suddenly c*** hope. W*** if the Morlocks w*** afraid? And close on the heels of t*** c*** a strange thing. The darkness seemed to g*** luminous. V*** dimly I began to see the Morlocks about meâ\\x80\\x94three battered at my feetâ\\x80\\x94and t*** I recognised, w*** incredulous surprise, t*** the others w*** running, in an incessant stream, as it seemed, f*** behind me, and a*** through the w*** in front. And their backs seemed no longer white, but reddish. As I stood agape, I saw a little red spark go drifting across a gap of starlight between the branches, and vanish. And at t*** I understood the smell of burning wood, the slumbrous murmur t*** was growing now i*** a gusty roar, the red glow, and the Morlocksâ\\x80\\x99 flight. â\\x80\\x9cStepping out f*** behind my t*** and looking back, I s*** through the black pillars of the nearer trees, the flames of the burning forest. It was my first f*** coming after me. W*** t*** I looked for Weena, but she was gone. The hissing and crackling behind me, the explosive t*** as e*** fresh t*** burst i*** flame, l*** little t*** for reflection. My i*** bar still gripped, I followed in the Morlocksâ\\x80\\x99 path. It was a close race. O*** the flames crept forward so swiftly on my right as I ran t*** I was outflanked and had to strike off to the left. But at l*** I emerged u*** a small o*** space, and as I did so, a Morlock c*** blundering towards me, and p*** me, and w*** on straight i*** the fire! â\\x80\\x9cAnd now I was to see the m*** weird and horrible thing, I think, of all t*** I beheld in t*** future age. T*** whole space was as bright as day w*** the reflection of the fire. In the centre was a hillock or tumulus, surmounted by a scorched hawthorn. Beyond t*** was another arm of the burning forest, w*** yellow tongues already writhing f*** it, completely encircling the space w*** a fence of fire. U*** the hillside w*** s*** thirty or forty Morlocks, dazzled by the light and heat, and blundering hither and thither against e*** other in their bewilderment. At first I did not realise their blindness, and struck furiously at t*** w*** my b*** in a frenzy of fear, as t*** approached me, killing one and crippling several more. But w*** I had watched the gestures of one of t*** groping under the hawthorn against the red s*** and heard their moans, I was assured of their absolute helplessness and misery in the glare, and I struck no m*** of them. â\\x80\\x9cYet every now and t*** one would c*** straight towards me, setting loose a quivering horror t*** m*** me quick to elude him. At one t*** the flames d*** d*** somewhat, and I feared the f*** creatures would presently be a*** to see me. I was thinking of beginning the fight by killing s*** of t*** before t*** should happen; but the f*** burst out again brightly, and I stayed my hand. I walked about the h*** among t*** and avoided them, looking for s*** trace of Weena. But Weena was gone. â\\x80\\x9cAt l*** I sat d*** on the summit of the hillock, and watched t*** strange incredible company of blind things groping to and f*** and making uncanny noises to e*** other, as the glare of the f*** b*** on them. The coiling uprush of smoke streamed across the s*** and through the r*** tatters of t*** red canopy, remote as though t*** belonged to another universe, shone the little stars. Two or three Morlocks c*** blundering i*** me, and I drove t*** off w*** blows of my fists, trembling as I did so. â\\x80\\x9cFor the m*** p*** of t*** night I was persuaded it was a nightmare. I bit myself and screamed in a passionate desire to awake. I b*** the ground w*** my hands, and got up and sat d*** again, and wandered h*** and there, and again sat down. T*** I would f*** to rubbing my e*** and calling u*** God to let me awake. Thrice I saw Morlocks put their heads d*** in a k*** of agony and r*** i*** the flames. B*** at last, above the subsiding red of the fire, above the streaming masses of black smoke and the whitening and blackening t*** stumps, and the diminishing numbers of these dim creatures, c*** the white light of the day. â*** searched again for traces of Weena, but there w*** none. It was plain t*** t*** had l*** her p*** little b*** in the forest. I cannot describe how it relieved me to think t*** it had escaped the awful f*** to which it seemed destined. As I thought of that, I was almost moved to begin a massacre of the helpless abominations about me, but I contained myself. The hillock, as I h*** said, was a k*** of island in the forest. F*** its summit I could now m*** out through a h*** of smoke the Palace of Green Porcelain, and f*** t*** I could get my bearings for the White Sphinx. And so, leaving the remnant of these damned souls still going hither and thither and moaning, as the day g*** clearer, I t*** s*** grass about my f*** and limped on across smoking ashes and among black stems t*** still pulsated internally w*** fire, towards the hiding-place of the T*** Machine. I walked slowly, for I was almost exhausted, as w*** as lame, and I f*** the intensest wretchedness for the horrible death of little Weena. It seemed an overwhelming calamity. N*** in t*** old familiar room, it is m*** l*** the sorrow of a dream t*** an actual loss. But t*** morning it l*** me absolutely lonely againâ\\x80\\x94terribly alone. I began to think of t*** house of mine, of t*** fireside, of s*** of y*** and w*** s*** thoughts c*** a longing t*** was pain. â\\x80\\x9cBut, as I walked o*** the smoking ashes under the bright morning s*** I m*** a discovery. In my trouser pocket w*** still s*** loose matches. The box m*** h*** leaked before it was lost. XIII. The T*** of the White Sphinx â\\x80\\x9cAbout eight or n*** in the morning I c*** to the s*** s*** of yellow metal f*** which I had viewed the world u*** the evening of my arrival. I thought of my hasty conclusions u*** t*** evening and could not refrain f*** laughing bitterly at my confidence. H*** was the s*** beautiful scene, the s*** abundant foliage, the s*** splendid palaces and magnificent ruins, the s*** silver river running between its fertile banks. The gay robes of the beautiful people moved hither and thither among the trees. S*** w*** bathing in exactly the place where I had saved Weena, and t*** suddenly g*** me a k*** s*** of pain. And l*** blots u*** the landscape r*** the cupolas above the w*** to the Underworld. I understood now w*** all the beauty of the Overworld people covered. V*** pleasant was their d*** as pleasant as the day of the cattle in the field. L*** the cattle, t*** k*** of no enemies and provided against no needs. And their end was the same. â*** grieved to think how brief the dream of the human intellect had been. It had committed suicide. It had set itself steadfastly towards comfort and ease, a balanced society w*** security and permanency as its watchword, it had attained its hopesâ\\x80\\x94to c*** to t*** at last. Once, l*** and property m*** h*** reached almost absolute safety. The r*** had b*** assured of his wealth and comfort, the toiler assured of his l*** and work. No doubt in t*** perfect world there had b*** no unemployed problem, no social question l*** unsolved. And a great quiet had followed. â\\x80\\x9cIt is a law of nature we overlook, t*** intellectual versatility is the compensation for change, danger, and trouble. An animal perfectly in harmony w*** its environment is a perfect mechanism. Nature never appeals to intelligence until habit and instinct are useless. There is no intelligence where there is no change and no n*** of change. O*** those animals partake of intelligence t*** h*** to m*** a h*** variety of needs and dangers. â\\x80\\x9cSo, as I see it, the Upperworld man had drifted towards his feeble prettiness, and the Underworld to m*** mechanical industry. But t*** perfect state had lacked one thing e*** for mechanical perfectionâ\\x80\\x94absolute permanency. Apparently as t*** w*** on, the feeding of an Underworld, however it was effected, had become disjointed. Mother Necessity, who had b*** staved off for a few thousand years, c*** b*** again, and she began below. The Underworld being in contact w*** machinery, which, however perfect, still needs s*** little thought outside habit, had probably retained perforce rather m*** initiative, if l*** of every other human character, t*** the Upper. And w*** other m*** failed them, t*** turned to w*** old habit had hitherto forbidden. So I say I saw it in my l*** v*** of the world of Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred and One. It may be as wrong an explanation as mortal wit could invent. It is how the thing shaped itself to me, and as t*** I g*** it to you. â\\x80\\x9cAfter the fatigues, excitements, and terrors of the p*** days, and in spite of my grief, t*** s*** and the tranquil v*** and the w*** sunlight w*** v*** pleasant. I was v*** tired and sleepy, and s*** my theorising passed i*** dozing. Catching myself at that, I t*** my own hint, and spreading myself out u*** the t*** I had a l*** and refreshing sleep. â*** awoke a little before sunsetting. I now f*** s*** against being caught napping by the Morlocks, a*** stretching myself, I c*** on d*** the h*** towards the White Sphinx. I had my crowbar in one hand, and the other h*** played w*** the matches in my pocket. â\\x80\\x9cAnd now c*** a m*** unexpected thing. As I approached the pedestal of the sphinx I found the bronze valves w*** open. T*** had s*** d*** i*** grooves. â\\x80\\x9cAt t*** I stopped short before them, hesitating to enter. â\\x80\\x9cWithin was a small apartment, and on a raised place in the corner of t*** was the T*** Machine. I had the small levers in my pocket. So here, after all my elaborate preparations for the siege of the White Sphinx, was a m*** surrender. I threw my i*** bar away, almost sorry not to use it. â*** sudden thought c*** i*** my h*** as I stooped towards the portal. For once, at least, I grasped the mental operations of the Morlocks. Suppressing a strong inclination to laugh, I stepped through the bronze frame and up to the T*** Machine. I was surprised to f*** it had b*** carefully oiled and cleaned. I h*** suspected since t*** the Morlocks had e*** partially taken it to pieces while trying in their dim way to grasp its purpose. â\\x80\\x9cNow as I stood and examined it, finding a pleasure in the m*** touch of the contrivance, the thing I had expected happened. The bronze panels suddenly s*** up and struck the frame w*** a clang. I was in the darkâ\\x80\\x94trapped. So the Morlocks thought. At t*** I chuckled gleefully. â*** could already h*** their murmuring laughter as t*** c*** towards me. V*** calmly I tried to strike the match. I had o*** to fix on the levers and depart t*** l*** a ghost. But I had overlooked one little thing. The matches w*** of t*** abominable k*** t*** light o*** on the box. â\\x80\\x9cYou may imagine how all my c*** vanished. The little brutes w*** close u*** me. One touched me. I m*** a sweeping b*** in the d*** at t*** w*** the levers, and began to scramble i*** the saddle of the machine. T*** c*** one h*** u*** me and t*** another. T*** I had simply to fight against their persistent fingers for my levers, and at the s*** t*** f*** for the studs o*** which these fitted. O*** indeed, t*** almost got a*** f*** me. As it slipped f*** my hand, I had to b*** in the d*** w*** my headâ\\x80\\x94I could h*** the Morlockâ\\x80\\x99s skull ringâ\\x80\\x94to recover it. It was a nearer thing t*** the fight in the forest, I think, t*** l*** scramble. â\\x80\\x9cBut at l*** the lever was fixed and pulled over. The clinging hands slipped f*** me. The darkness presently f*** f*** my eyes. I found myself in the s*** g*** light and tumult I h*** already described. XIV. The Further Vision â*** h*** already t*** you of the sickness and confusion t*** comes w*** t*** travelling. And t*** t*** I was not seated properly in the saddle, but sideways and in an unstable fashion. For an indefinite t*** I clung to the machine as it swayed and vibrated, quite unheeding how I went, and w*** I brought myself to l*** at the dials again I was amazed to f*** where I had arrived. One d*** records days, and another thousands of days, another millions of days, and another thousands of millions. N*** instead of reversing the levers, I had pulled t*** o*** so as to go forward w*** them, and w*** I c*** to l*** at these indicators I found t*** the thousands h*** was sweeping round as f*** as the seconds h*** of a watchâ\\x80\\x94into futurity. â\\x80\\x9cAs I drove on, a peculiar change crept o*** the appearance of things. The palpitating greyness g*** darker; thenâ\\x80\\x94though I was still travelling w*** prodigious velocityâ\\x80\\x94the blinking succession of day and night, which was usually indicative of a slower pace, returned, and g*** m*** and m*** marked. T*** puzzled me v*** m*** at first. The alternations of night and day g*** slower and slower, and so did the passage of the sun across the s*** until t*** seemed to stretch through centuries. At l*** a steady twilight brooded o*** the earth, a twilight o*** broken now and t*** w*** a comet glared across the darkling sky. The b*** of light t*** had indicated the sun had l*** since disappeared; for the sun had ceased to setâ\\x80\\x94it simply r*** and f*** in the west, and g*** e*** broader and m*** red. All trace of the m*** had vanished. The circling of the stars, growing slower and slower, had given place to creeping points of light. At last, s*** t*** before I stopped, the s*** red and v*** large, halted motionless u*** the horizon, a v*** d*** glowing w*** a d*** heat, and now and t*** suffering a momentary extinction. At one t*** it had for a little while glowed m*** brilliantly again, but it speedily reverted to its sullen red heat. I perceived by t*** slowing d*** of its rising and setting t*** the w*** of the tidal d*** was done. The earth had c*** to r*** w*** one f*** to the s*** e*** as in our own t*** the m*** faces the earth. V*** cautiously, for I remembered my former headlong fall, I began to reverse my motion. Slower and slower w*** the circling hands until the thousands one seemed motionless and the daily one was no longer a m*** m*** u*** its scale. Still slower, until the dim outlines of a desolate beach g*** visible. â*** stopped v*** gently and sat u*** the T*** Machine, looking round. The sky was no longer blue. North-eastward it was i*** black, and out of the blackness shone brightly and steadily the p*** white stars. Overhead it was a d*** Indian red and starless, and south-eastward it g*** brighter to a glowing scarlet where, cut by the horizon, lay the h*** h*** of the s*** red and motionless. The rocks about me w*** of a harsh reddish colour, and all the trace of l*** t*** I could see at first was the intensely green vegetation t*** covered every projecting point on their south-eastern face. It was the s*** r*** green t*** one s*** on forest m*** or on the lichen in caves: plants which l*** these g*** in a perpetual twilight. â\\x80\\x9cThe machine was standing on a sloping beach. The sea stretched a*** to the south-west, to r*** i*** a sharp bright horizon against the wan sky. There w*** no breakers and no waves, for not a breath of w*** was stirring. O*** a slight o*** swell r*** and f*** l*** a gentle breathing, and showed t*** the eternal sea was still moving and living. And along the margin where the water sometimes broke was a thick incrustation of saltâ\\x80\\x94pink under the lurid sky. There was a sense of oppression in my head, and I noticed t*** I was breathing v*** fast. The sensation reminded me of my o*** experience of mountaineering, and f*** t*** I judged the air to be m*** rarefied t*** it is now. â\\x80\\x9cFar a*** up the desolate slope I heard a harsh scream, and saw a thing l*** a h*** white butterfly go slanting and fluttering up i*** the sky a*** circling, disappear o*** s*** low hillocks beyond. The sound of its voice was so dismal t*** I shivered and seated myself m*** firmly u*** the machine. Looking round me again, I saw that, quite near, w*** I had taken to be a reddish m*** of r*** was moving slowly towards me. T*** I saw the thing was really a monstrous crab-like creature. Can you imagine a c*** as large as yonder table, w*** its m*** l*** moving slowly and uncertainly, its big claws swaying, its l*** antennÃ¦, l*** cartersâ\\x80\\x99 whips, waving and feeling, and its stalked e*** gleaming at you on either s*** of its metallic front? Its b*** was corrugated and ornamented w*** ungainly bosses, and a greenish incrustation blotched it h*** and there. I could see the m*** palps of its complicated mouth flickering and feeling as it moved. â\\x80\\x9cAs I stared at t*** sinister apparition crawling towards me, I f*** a tickling on my cheek as though a fly had lighted there. I tried to brush it a*** w*** my hand, but in a moment it returned, and almost immediately c*** another by my ear. I struck at this, and caught something threadlike. It was drawn swiftly out of my hand. W*** a frightful qualm, I turned, and I saw t*** I had grasped the antenna of another monster c*** t*** stood j*** behind me. Its e*** e*** w*** wriggling on their stalks, its mouth was all alive w*** appetite, and its v*** ungainly claws, smeared w*** an algal slime, w*** descending u*** me. In a moment my h*** was on the lever, and I had placed a month between myself and these monsters. But I was still on the s*** beach, and I saw t*** distinctly now as s*** as I stopped. Dozens of t*** seemed to be crawling h*** and there, in the sombre light, among the foliated sheets of intense green. â*** cannot convey the sense of abominable desolation t*** h*** o*** the world. The red eastern s*** the northward blackness, the s*** D*** S*** the stony beach crawling w*** these foul, slow-stirring monsters, the uniform poisonous-looking green of the lichenous plants, the t*** air t*** hurts oneâ\\x80\\x99s lungs: all contributed to an appalling effect. I moved on a hundred years, and there was the s*** red sunâ\\x80\\x94a little larger, a little dullerâ\\x80\\x94the s*** dying s*** the s*** chill a*** and the s*** crowd of earthy crustacea creeping in and out among the green w*** and the red rocks. And in the westward s*** I saw a curved p*** l*** l*** a v*** new moon. â\\x80\\x9cSo I travelled, stopping e*** and again, in great strides of a thousand years or more, drawn on by the mystery of the earthâ\\x80\\x99s fate, watching w*** a strange fascination the sun g*** larger and duller in the westward s*** and the l*** of the old earth ebb away. At last, m*** t*** thirty million years hence, the h*** red-hot d*** of the sun had c*** to obscure nearly a tenth p*** of the darkling heavens. T*** I stopped o*** more, for the crawling multitude of crabs had disappeared, and the red beach, s*** for its livid green liverworts and lichens, seemed lifeless. And now it was flecked w*** white. A bitter c*** assailed me. R*** white flakes e*** and again c*** eddying down. To the north-eastward, the glare of s*** lay under the starlight of the sable s*** and I could see an undulating crest of hillocks pinkish white. There w*** fringes of ice along the sea margin, w*** drifting masses farther o*** but the m*** expanse of t*** s*** ocean, all bloody under the eternal sunset, was still unfrozen. â*** looked about me to see if any traces of animal l*** remained. A certain indefinable apprehension still k*** me in the saddle of the machine. But I saw nothing moving, in earth or sky or sea. The green slime on the rocks alone testified t*** l*** was not extinct. A shallow sandbank had appeared in the sea and the water had receded f*** the beach. I fancied I saw s*** black object flopping about u*** t*** bank, but it became motionless as I looked at it, and I judged t*** my eye had b*** deceived, and t*** the black object was merely a rock. The stars in the sky w*** intensely bright and seemed to me to twinkle v*** little. â\\x80\\x9cSuddenly I noticed t*** the circular westward outline of the sun had changed; t*** a concavity, a b*** had appeared in the curve. I saw t*** g*** larger. For a minute perhaps I stared aghast at t*** blackness t*** was creeping o*** the d*** and t*** I realised t*** an eclipse was beginning. Either the m*** or the planet Mercury was passing across the sunâ\\x80\\x99s disk. Naturally, at first I t*** it to be the moon, but there is m*** to incline me to believe t*** w*** I really saw was the transit of an inner planet passing v*** n*** to the earth. â\\x80\\x9cThe darkness g*** apace; a c*** w*** began to b*** in freshening gusts f*** the east, and the showering white flakes in the air increased in number. F*** the e*** of the sea c*** a ripple and whisper. Beyond these lifeless sounds the world was silent. Silent? It would be h*** to convey the stillness of it. All the sounds of m*** the bleating of sheep, the cries of birds, the hum of insects, the s*** t*** makes the background of our livesâ\\x80\\x94all t*** was over. As the darkness thickened, the eddying flakes g*** m*** abundant, dancing before my eyes; and the c*** of the air m*** intense. At last, one by o*** swiftly, one after the other, the white peaks of the distant hills vanished i*** blackness. The breeze r*** to a moaning wind. I saw the black central shadow of the eclipse sweeping towards me. In another moment the p*** stars alone w*** visible. All e*** was rayless obscurity. The sky was absolutely black. â*** horror of t*** great darkness c*** on me. The cold, t*** smote to my marrow, and the p*** I f*** in breathing, overcame me. I shivered, and a deadly nausea seized me. T*** l*** a red-hot bow in the sky appeared the e*** of the sun. I got off the machine to recover myself. I f*** giddy and incapable of facing the return journey. As I stood s*** and confused I saw again the moving thing u*** the shoalâ\\x80\\x94there was no mistake now t*** it was a moving thingâ\\x80\\x94against the red water of the sea. It was a round thing, the s*** of a football perhaps, or, it may be, bigger, and tentacles trailed d*** f*** it; it seemed black against the weltering blood-red water, and it was hopping fitfully about. T*** I f*** I was fainting. But a terrible dread of lying helpless in t*** remote and awful twilight sustained me while I clambered u*** the saddle. XV. The T*** Travellerâ\\x80\\x99s Return â\\x80\\x9cSo I c*** back. For a l*** t*** I m*** h*** b*** insensible u*** the machine. The blinking succession of the d*** and nights was resumed, the sun got golden again, the sky blue. I breathed w*** greater freedom. The fluctuating contours of the l*** ebbed and flowed. The hands s*** backward u*** the dials. At l*** I saw again the dim shadows of houses, the evidences of decadent humanity. These, t*** changed and passed, and others came. Presently, w*** the million d*** was at zero, I slackened speed. I began to recognise our own pretty and familiar architecture, the thousands h*** ran b*** to the starting-point, the night and day flapped slower and slower. T*** the old walls of the laboratory c*** round me. V*** gently, n*** I slowed the mechanism down. â*** saw one little thing t*** seemed odd to me. I think I h*** t*** you t*** w*** I set o*** before my velocity became v*** high, Mrs. Watchett had walked across the room, travelling, as it seemed to me, l*** a rocket. As I returned, I passed again across t*** minute w*** she traversed the laboratory. But now her every motion appeared to be the exact inversion of her previous ones. The d*** at the lower end opened, and she glided quietly up the laboratory, b*** foremost, and disappeared behind the d*** by which she had previously entered. J*** before t*** I seemed to see Hillyer for a moment; but he passed l*** a flash. â\\x80\\x9cThen I stopped the machine, and saw about me again the old familiar laboratory, my tools, my appliances j*** as I had l*** them. I got off the thing v*** shakily, and sat d*** u*** my bench. For several minutes I trembled violently. T*** I became calmer. Around me was my old workshop again, exactly as it had been. I might h*** slept there, and the whole thing h*** b*** a dream. â\\x80\\x9cAnd y*** not exactly! The thing had started f*** the south-east corner of the laboratory. It had c*** to r*** again in the north-west, against the w*** where you saw it. T*** gives you the exact distance f*** my little l*** to the pedestal of the White Sphinx, i*** which the Morlocks had carried my machine. â\\x80\\x9cFor a t*** my brain w*** stagnant. Presently I got up and c*** through the passage here, limping, because my h*** was still painful, and feeling sorely begrimed. I saw the _Pall M*** Gazette_ on the table by the door. I found the d*** was indeed today, and looking at the timepiece, saw the h*** was almost eight oâ\\x80\\x99clock. I heard y*** voices and the clatter of plates. I hesitatedâ\\x80\\x94I f*** so s*** and weak. T*** I sniffed g*** wholesome meat, and opened the d*** on you. You k*** the rest. I washed, and dined, and now I am telling you the story. XVI. After the Story â*** know,â\\x80\\x9d he said, after a pause, â\\x80\\x9cthat all t*** w*** be absolutely incredible to y*** but to me the one incredible thing is t*** I am h*** tonight in t*** old familiar r*** looking i*** y*** friendly faces and telling you these strange adventures.â\\x80\\x9d He looked at the Medical Man. â\\x80\\x9cNo. I cannot expect you to believe it. T*** it as a lieâ\\x80\\x94or a prophecy. Say I dreamed it in the workshop. Consider I h*** b*** speculating u*** the destinies of our race, until I h*** hatched t*** fiction. Treat my assertion of its truth as a m*** stroke of art to enhance its interest. And taking it as a story, w*** do you think of it?â\\x80\\x9d He t*** up his pipe, and began, in his old accustomed manner, to tap w*** it nervously u*** the b*** of the grate. There was a momentary stillness. T*** chairs began to creak and shoes to scrape u*** the carpet. I t*** my e*** off the T*** Travellerâ\\x80\\x99s face, and looked round at his audience. T*** w*** in the dark, and little spots of colour s*** before them. The Medical Man seemed absorbed in the contemplation of our host. The Editor was looking h*** at the end of his cigarâ\\x80\\x94the sixth. The Journalist fumbled for his watch. The others, as far as I remember, w*** motionless. The Editor stood up w*** a sigh. â\\x80\\x9cWhat a p*** it is youâ\\x80\\x99re not a writer of stories!â\\x80\\x9d he said, putting his h*** on the T*** Travellerâ\\x80\\x99s shoulder. â\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t believe it?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWellâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â*** thought not.â\\x80\\x9d The T*** Traveller turned to us. â\\x80\\x9cWhere are the matches?â\\x80\\x9d he said. He lit one and spoke o*** his pipe, puffing. â\\x80\\x9cTo t*** you the truth... I hardly believe it myself..... And yet...â\\x80\\x9d His eye f*** w*** a m*** inquiry u*** the withered white flowers u*** the little table. T*** he turned o*** the h*** holding his pipe, and I saw he was looking at s*** half-healed scars on his knuckles. The Medical Man rose, c*** to the lamp, and examined the flowers. â\\x80\\x9cThe gynÃ¦ceumâ\\x80\\x99s odd,â\\x80\\x9d he said. The Psychologist leant forward to s*** holding out his h*** for a specimen. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m hanged if it isnâ\\x80\\x99t a quarter to one,â\\x80\\x9d s*** the Journalist. â\\x80\\x9cHow shall we get home?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cPlenty of c*** at the station,â\\x80\\x9d s*** the Psychologist. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a curious thing,â\\x80\\x9d s*** the Medical M*** â\\x80\\x9cbut I certainly donâ\\x80\\x99t k*** the natural order of these flowers. May I h*** them?â\\x80\\x9d The T*** Traveller hesitated. T*** suddenly: â\\x80\\x9cCertainly not.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhere did you really get them?â\\x80\\x9d s*** the Medical Man. The T*** Traveller put his h*** to his head. He spoke l*** one who was trying to k*** h*** of an i*** t*** eluded him. â\\x80\\x9cThey w*** put i*** my pocket by Weena, w*** I travelled i*** Time.â\\x80\\x9d He stared round the room. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m damned if it isnâ\\x80\\x99t all going. T*** r*** and you and the atmosphere of every day is too m*** for my memory. Did I e*** m*** a T*** Machine, or a model of a T*** Machine? Or is it all o*** a dream? T*** say l*** is a dream, a precious p*** dream at timesâ\\x80\\x94but I canâ\\x80\\x99t stand another t*** wonâ\\x80\\x99t fit. Itâ\\x80\\x99s madness. And where did the dream c*** from? â\\x80¦ I m*** l*** at t*** machine. If there is one!â\\x80\\x9d He caught up the l*** swiftly, and carried it, flaring r*** through the d*** i*** the corridor. We followed him. There in the flickering light of the l*** was the machine s*** enough, squat, ugly, and askew, a thing of brass, ebony, ivory, and translucent glimmering quartz. Solid to the touchâ\\x80\\x94for I put out my h*** and f*** the r*** of itâ\\x80\\x94and w*** brown spots and smears u*** the ivory, and b*** of grass and m*** u*** the lower parts, and one r*** b*** awry. The T*** Traveller put the l*** d*** on the bench, and ran his h*** along the damaged rail. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s all right now,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cThe story I t*** you was true. Iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry to h*** brought you out h*** in the cold.â\\x80\\x9d He t*** up the lamp, a*** in an absolute silence, we returned to the smoking-room. He c*** i*** the h*** w*** us and helped the Editor on w*** his coat. The Medical Man looked i*** his f*** a*** w*** a certain hesitation, t*** him he was suffering f*** overwork, at which he laughed hugely. I remember him standing in the o*** doorway, bawling good-night. I shared a cab w*** the Editor. He thought the t*** a â\\x80\\x9cgaudy lie.â\\x80\\x9d For my own p*** I was unable to c*** to a conclusion. The story was so fantastic and incredible, the telling so credible and sober. I lay awake m*** of the night thinking about it. I determined to go n*** day and see the T*** Traveller again. I was t*** he was in the laboratory, and being on e*** terms in the house, I w*** up to him. The laboratory, however, was empty. I stared for a minute at the T*** Machine and put out my h*** and touched the lever. At t*** the squat substantial-looking m*** swayed l*** a bough shaken by the wind. Its instability startled me extremely, and I had a queer reminiscence of the childish d*** w*** I u*** to be forbidden to meddle. I c*** b*** through the corridor. The T*** Traveller met me in the smoking-room. He was coming f*** the house. He had a small camera under one arm and a knapsack under the other. He laughed w*** he saw me, and g*** me an elbow to shake. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m frightfully busy,â\\x80\\x9d s*** he, â\\x80\\x9cwith t*** thing in there.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cBut is it not s*** hoax?â\\x80\\x9d I said. â\\x80\\x9cDo you really travel through time?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cReally and truly I do.â\\x80\\x9d And he looked frankly i*** my eyes. He hesitated. His eye wandered about the room. â*** o*** w*** h*** an hour,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â*** k*** why you came, and itâ\\x80\\x99s awfully g*** of you. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s s*** magazines here. If youâ\\x80\\x99ll s*** to lunch Iâ\\x80\\x99ll prove you t*** t*** travelling up to the hilt, specimens and all. If youâ\\x80\\x99ll forgive my leaving you now?â\\x80\\x9d I consented, hardly comprehending t*** the f*** import of his words, and he nodded and w*** on d*** the corridor. I heard the d*** of the laboratory slam, seated myself in a chair, and t*** up a daily paper. W*** was he going to do before lunch-time? T*** suddenly I was reminded by an advertisement t*** I had promised to m*** Richardson, the publisher, at two. I looked at my watch, and saw t*** I could barely s*** t*** engagement. I got up and w*** d*** the passage to t*** the T*** Traveller. As I t*** h*** of the handle of the d*** I heard an exclamation, oddly truncated at the e*** and a click and a thud. A g*** of air whirled round me as I opened the door, and f*** within c*** the sound of broken glass falling on the floor. The T*** Traveller was not there. I seemed to see a ghostly, indistinct figure sitting in a whirling m*** of black and brass for a momentâ\\x80\\x94a figure so transparent t*** the bench behind w*** its sheets of drawings was absolutely distinct; but t*** phantasm vanished as I rubbed my eyes. The T*** Machine had gone. S*** for a subsiding s*** of dust, the further end of the laboratory was empty. A p*** of the skylight h*** apparently, j*** b*** blown in. I f*** an unreasonable amazement. I k*** t*** something strange had happened, and for the moment could not distinguish w*** the strange thing might be. As I stood staring, the d*** i*** the garden opened, and the man-servant appeared. We looked at e*** other. T*** ideas began to come. â\\x80\\x9cHas Mr. â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94 g*** out t*** way?â\\x80\\x9d s*** I. â\\x80\\x9cNo, sir. No one has c*** out t*** way. I was expecting to f*** him here.â\\x80\\x9d At t*** I understood. At the r*** of disappointing Richardson I stayed on, waiting for the T*** Traveller; waiting for the second, perhaps still stranger story, and the specimens and photographs he would bring w*** him. But I am beginning now to f*** t*** I m*** w*** a lifetime. The T*** Traveller vanished three years ago. A*** as everybody knows n*** he has never returned. Epilogue One cannot choose but wonder. W*** he e*** return? It may be t*** he swept b*** i*** the past, and f*** among the blood-drinking, hairy savages of the Age of Unpolished Stone; i*** the abysses of the Cretaceous S*** or among the grotesque saurians, the h*** reptilian brutes of the Jurassic times. He may e*** nowâ\\x80\\x94if I may use the phraseâ\\x80\\x94be wandering on s*** plesiosaurus-haunted Oolitic coral reef, or beside the lonely saline s*** of the Triassic Age. Or did he go forward, i*** one of the nearer ages, in which men are still m*** but w*** the riddles of our own t*** answered and its wearisome problems solved? I*** the manhood of the race: for I, for my own part, cannot think t*** these latter d*** of w*** experiment, fragmentary theory, and mutual discord are indeed manâ\\x80\\x99s culminating time! I s*** for my own part. He, I knowâ\\x80\\x94for the question had b*** discussed among us l*** before the T*** Machine was madeâ\\x80\\x94thought but cheerlessly of the Advancement of Mankind, and saw in the growing p*** of civilisation o*** a foolish heaping t*** m*** inevitably f*** b*** u*** and destroy its makers in the end. If t*** is so, it remains for us to l*** as though it w*** not so. But to me the future is still black and blankâ\\x80\\x94is a v*** ignorance, lit at a few casual places by the memory of his story. And I h*** by me, for my comfort, two strange white flowersâ\\x80\\x94shrivelled n*** and brown and f*** and brittleâ\\x80\\x94to witness t*** e*** w*** m*** and strength had gone, gratitude and a mutual tenderness still lived on in the heart of man. *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE T*** MACHINE *** ***** T*** f*** should be named 35-0.txt or 35-0.zip ***** T*** and all associated files of various formats w*** be found in: https://www.gutenberg.org/3/35/ Updated editions w*** replace the previous one--the old editions w*** be renamed.
