IntroductionThe Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him) wasexpounding a recondite matter to us. His pale grey eyes shone andtwinkled, and his usually pale face was flushed and animated. The fireburnt brightly, and the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in thelilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in ourglasses. Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and caressed us ratherthan submitted to be sat upon, and there was that luxuriousafter-dinner atmosphere, when thought runs gracefully free of thetrammels of precision. And he put it to us in this waymarking thepoints with a lean forefingeras we sat and lazily admired hisearnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it) and his fecundity.You must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert one or twoideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry, for instance,they taught you at school is founded on a misconception.Is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon? saidFilby, an argumentative person with red hair.I do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable groundfor it. You will soon admit as much as I need from you. You know ofcourse that a mathematical line, a line of thickness nil, has no realexistence. They taught you that? Neither has a mathematical plane.These things are mere abstractions.That is all right, said the Psychologist.Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have areal existence.There I object, said Filby. Of course a solid body may exist. Allreal thingsSo most people think. But wait a moment. Can an instantaneous cubeexist?Dont follow you, said Filby.Can a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a realexistence?Filby became pensive. Clearly, the Time Traveller proceeded, anyreal body must have extension in four directions: it must haveLength, Breadth, Thickness, andDuration. But through a naturalinfirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in a moment, weincline to overlook this fact. There are really four dimensions, threewhich we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time. There is,however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the formerthree dimensions and the latter, because it happens that ourconsciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latterfrom the beginning to the end of our lives.That, said a very young man, making spasmodic efforts to relight hiscigar over the lamp; that . . . very clear indeed.Now, it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked,continued the Time Traveller, with a slight accession of cheerfulness.Really this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension, though somepeople who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not know they mean it. Itis only another way of looking at Time. There is no difference betweenTime and any of the three dimensions of Space except that ourconsciousness moves along it. But some foolish people have got hold ofthe wrong side of that idea. You have all heard what they have to sayabout this Fourth Dimension?I have not, said the Provincial Mayor.It is simply this. That Space, as our mathematicians have it, isspoken of as having three dimensions, which one may call Length,Breadth, and Thickness, and is always definable by reference to threeplanes, each at right angles to the others. But some philosophicalpeople have been asking why three dimensions particularlywhy notanother direction at right angles to the other three?and have eventried to construct a Four-Dimensional geometry. Professor Simon Newcombwas expounding this to the New York Mathematical Society only a monthor so ago. You know how on a flat surface, which has only twodimensions, we can represent a figure of a three-dimensional solid, andsimilarly they think that by models of three dimensions they couldrepresent one of fourif they could master the perspective of thething. See?I think so, murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, knitting his brows,he lapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as one whorepeats mystic words. Yes, I think I see it now, he said after sometime, brightening in a quite transitory manner.Well, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this geometryof Four Dimensions for some time. Some of my results are curious. Forinstance, here is a portrait of a man at eight years old, another atfifteen, another at seventeen, another at twenty-three, and so on. Allthese are evidently sections, as it were, Three-Dimensionalrepresentations of his Four-Dimensioned being, which is a fixed andunalterable thing.Scientific people, proceeded the Time Traveller, after the pauserequired for the proper assimilation of this, know very well that Timeis only a kind of Space. Here is a popular scientific diagram, aweather record. This line I trace with my finger shows the movement ofthe barometer. Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night it fell, thenthis morning it rose again, and so gently upward to here. Surely themercury did not trace this line in any of the dimensions of Spacegenerally recognised? But certainly it traced such a line, and thatline, therefore, we must conclude, was along the Time-Dimension.But, said the Medical Man, staring hard at a coal in the fire, ifTime is really only a fourth dimension of Space, why is it, and why hasit always been, regarded as something different? And why cannot we movein Time as we move about in the other dimensions of Space?The Time Traveller smiled. Are you so sure we can move freely inSpace? Right and left we can go, backward and forward freely enough,and men always have done so. I admit we move freely in two dimensions.But how about up and down? Gravitation limits us there.Not exactly, said the Medical Man. There are balloons.But before the balloons, save for spasmodic jumping and theinequalities of the surface, man had no freedom of vertical movement.Still they could move a little up and down, said the Medical Man.Easier, far easier down than up.And you cannot move at all in Time, you cannot get away from thepresent moment.My dear sir, that is just where you are wrong. That is just where thewhole world has gone wrong. We are always getting away from the presentmoment. Our mental existences, which are immaterial and have nodimensions, are passing along the Time-Dimension with a uniformvelocity from the cradle to the grave. Just as we should travel downif we began our existence fifty miles above the earths surface.But the great difficulty is this, interrupted the Psychologist. Youcan move about in all directions of Space, but you cannot move aboutin Time.That is the germ of my great discovery. But you are wrong to say thatwe cannot move about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling anincident very vividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence: Ibecome absent-minded, as you say. I jump back for a moment. Of coursewe have no means of staying back for any length of Time, any more thana savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the ground. But acivilised man is better off than the savage in this respect. He can goup against gravitation in a balloon, and why should he not hope thatultimately he may be able to stop or accelerate his drift along theTime-Dimension, or even turn about and travel the other way?Oh, this, began Filby, is allWhy not? said the Time Traveller.Its against reason, said Filby.What reason? said the Time Traveller.You can show black is white by argument, said Filby, but you willnever convince me.Possibly not, said the Time Traveller. But now you begin to see theobject of my investigations into the geometry of Four Dimensions. Longago I had a vague inkling of a machineTo travel through Time! exclaimed the Very Young Man.That shall travel indifferently in any direction of Space and Time, asthe driver determines.Filby contented himself with laughter.But I have experimental verification, said the Time Traveller.It would be remarkably convenient for the historian, the Psychologistsuggested. One might travel back and verify the accepted account ofthe Battle of Hastings, for instance!Dont you think you would attract attention? said the Medical Man.Our ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms.One might get ones Greek from the very lips of Homer and Plato, theVery Young Man thought.In which case they would certainly plough you for the Little-go. TheGerman scholars have improved Greek so much.Then there is the future, said the Very Young Man. Just think! Onemight invest all ones money, leave it to accumulate at interest, andhurry on ahead!To discover a society, said I, erected on a strictly communisticbasis.Of all the wild extravagant theories! began the Psychologist.Yes, so it seemed to me, and so I never talked of it untilExperimental verification! cried I. You are going to verify that?The experiment! cried Filby, who was getting brain-weary.Lets see your experiment anyhow, said the Psychologist, though itsall humbug, you know.The Time Traveller smiled round at us. Then, still smiling faintly, andwith his hands deep in his trousers pockets, he walked slowly out ofthe room, and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long passage tohis laboratory.The Psychologist looked at us. I wonder what hes got?Some sleight-of-hand trick or other, said the Medical Man, and Filbytried to tell us about a conjuror he had seen at Burslem, but before hehad finished his preface the Time Traveller came back, and Filbysanecdote collapsed. II. The MachineThe thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering metallicframework, scarcely larger than a small clock, and very delicatelymade. There was ivory in it, and some transparent crystallinesubstance. And now I must be explicit, for this that followsunless hisexplanation is to be acceptedis an absolutely unaccountable thing. Hetook one of the small octagonal tables that were scattered about theroom, and set it in front of the fire, with two legs on the hearthrug.On this table he placed the mechanism. Then he drew up a chair, and satdown. The only other object on the table was a small shaded lamp, thebright light of which fell upon the model. There were also perhaps adozen candles about, two in brass candlesticks upon the mantel andseveral in sconces, so that the room was brilliantly illuminated. I satin a low arm-chair nearest the fire, and I drew this forward so as tobe almost between the Time Traveller and the fireplace. Filby satbehind him, looking over his shoulder. The Medical Man and theProvincial Mayor watched him in profile from the right, thePsychologist from the left. The Very Young Man stood behind thePsychologist. We were all on the alert. It appears incredible to methat any kind of trick, however subtly conceived and however adroitlydone, could have been played upon us under these conditions.The Time Traveller looked at us, and then at the mechanism. Well?said the Psychologist.This little affair, said the Time Traveller, resting his elbows uponthe table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus, is onlya model. It is my plan for a machine to travel through time. You willnotice that it looks singularly askew, and that there is an oddtwinkling appearance about this bar, as though it was in some wayunreal. He pointed to the part with his finger. Also, here is onelittle white lever, and here is another.The Medical Man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing.Its beautifully made, he said.It took two years to make, retorted the Time Traveller. Then, when wehad all imitated the action of the Medical Man, he said: Now I wantyou clearly to understand that this lever, being pressed over, sendsthe machine gliding into the future, and this other reverses themotion. This saddle represents the seat of a time traveller. PresentlyI am going to press the lever, and off the machine will go. It willvanish, pass into future Time, and disappear. Have a good look at thething. Look at the table too, and satisfy yourselves there is notrickery. I dont want to waste this model, and then be told Im aquack.There was a minutes pause perhaps. The Psychologist seemed about tospeak to me, but changed his mind. Then the Time Traveller put forthhis finger towards the lever. No, he said suddenly. Lend me yourhand. And turning to the Psychologist, he took that individuals handin his own and told him to put out his forefinger. So that it was thePsychologist himself who sent forth the model Time Machine on itsinterminable voyage. We all saw the lever turn. I am absolutely certainthere was no trickery. There was a breath of wind, and the lamp flamejumped. One of the candles on the mantel was blown out, and the littlemachine suddenly swung round, became indistinct, was seen as a ghostfor a second perhaps, as an eddy of faintly glittering brass and ivory;and it was gonevanished! Save for the lamp the table was bare.Everyone was silent for a minute. Then Filby said he was damned.The Psychologist recovered from his stupor, and suddenly looked underthe table. At that the Time Traveller laughed cheerfully. Well? hesaid, with a reminiscence of the Psychologist. Then, getting up, hewent to the tobacco jar on the mantel, and with his back to us began tofill his pipe.We stared at each other. Look here, said the Medical Man, are you inearnest about this? Do you seriously believe that that machine hastravelled into time?Certainly, said the Time Traveller, stooping to light a spill at thefire. Then he turned, lighting his pipe, to look at the Psychologistsface. (The Psychologist, to show that he was not unhinged, helpedhimself to a cigar and tried to light it uncut.) What is more, I havea big machine nearly finished in therehe indicated thelaboratoryand when that is put together I mean to have a journey onmy own account.You mean to say that that machine has travelled into the future? saidFilby.Into the future or the pastI dont, for certain, know which.After an interval the Psychologist had an inspiration. It must havegone into the past if it has gone anywhere, he said.Why? said the Time Traveller.Because I presume that it has not moved in space, and if it travelledinto the future it would still be here all this time, since it musthave travelled through this time.But, said I, If it travelled into the past it would have beenvisible when we came first into this room; and last Thursday when wewere here; and the Thursday before that; and so forth!Serious objections, remarked the Provincial Mayor, with an air ofimpartiality, turning towards the Time Traveller.Not a bit, said the Time Traveller, and, to the Psychologist: Youthink. You can explain that. Its presentation below the threshold,you know, diluted presentation.Of course, said the Psychologist, and reassured us. Thats a simplepoint of psychology. I should have thought of it. Its plain enough,and helps the paradox delightfully. We cannot see it, nor can weappreciate this machine, any more than we can the spoke of a wheelspinning, or a bullet flying through the air. If it is travellingthrough time fifty times or a hundred times faster than we are, if itgets through a minute while we get through a second, the impression itcreates will of course be only one-fiftieth or one-hundredth of what itwould make if it were not travelling in time. Thats plain enough. Hepassed his hand through the space in which the machine had been. Yousee? he said, laughing.We sat and stared at the vacant table for a minute or so. Then the TimeTraveller asked us what we thought of it all.It sounds plausible enough tonight, said the Medical Man; but waituntil tomorrow. Wait for the common sense of the morning.Would you like to see the Time Machine itself? asked the TimeTraveller. And therewith, taking the lamp in his hand, he led the waydown the long, draughty corridor to his laboratory. I remember vividlythe flickering light, his queer, broad head in silhouette, the dance ofthe shadows, how we all followed him, puzzled but incredulous, and howthere in the laboratory we beheld a larger edition of the littlemechanism which we had seen vanish from before our eyes. Parts were ofnickel, parts of ivory, parts had certainly been filed or sawn out ofrock crystal. The thing was generally complete, but the twistedcrystalline bars lay unfinished upon the bench beside some sheets ofdrawings, and I took one up for a better look at it. Quartz it seemedto be.Look here, said the Medical Man, are you perfectly serious? Or isthis a tricklike that ghost you showed us last Christmas?Upon that machine, said the Time Traveller, holding the lamp aloft,I intend to explore time. Is that plain? I was never more serious inmy life.None of us quite knew how to take it.I caught Filbys eye over the shoulder of the Medical Man, and hewinked at me solemnly. III. The Time Traveller ReturnsI think that at that time none of us quite believed in the TimeMachine. The fact is, the Time Traveller was one of those men who aretoo clever to be believed: you never felt that you saw all round him;you always suspected some subtle reserve, some ingenuity in ambush,behind his lucid frankness. Had Filby shown the model and explained thematter in the Time Travellers words, we should have shown him farless scepticism. For we should have perceived his motives: apork-butcher could understand Filby. But the Time Traveller had morethan a touch of whim among his elements, and we distrusted him. Thingsthat would have made the fame of a less clever man seemed tricks in hishands. It is a mistake to do things too easily. The serious people whotook him seriously never felt quite sure of his deportment; they weresomehow aware that trusting their reputations for judgment with him waslike furnishing a nursery with eggshell china. So I dont think any ofus said very much about time travelling in the interval between thatThursday and the next, though its odd potentialities ran, no doubt, inmost of our minds: its plausibility, that is, its practicalincredibleness, the curious possibilities of anachronism and of utterconfusion it suggested. For my own part, I was particularly preoccupiedwith the trick of the model. That I remember discussing with theMedical Man, whom I met on Friday at the LinnÃ¦an. He said he had seen asimilar thing at TÃ¼bingen, and laid considerable stress on theblowing-out of the candle. But how the trick was done he could notexplain.The next Thursday I went again to RichmondI suppose I was one of theTime Travellers most constant guestsand, arriving late, found four orfive men already assembled in his drawing-room. The Medical Man wasstanding before the fire with a sheet of paper in one hand and hiswatch in the other. I looked round for the Time Traveller, andItshalf-past seven now, said the Medical Man. I suppose wed better havedinner?Wheres? said I, naming our host.Youve just come? Its rather odd. Hes unavoidably detained. He asksme in this note to lead off with dinner at seven if hes not back. Sayshell explain when he comes.It seems a pity to let the dinner spoil, said the Editor of awell-known daily paper; and thereupon the Doctor rang the bell.The Psychologist was the only person besides the Doctor and myself whohad attended the previous dinner. The other men were Blank, the Editoraforementioned, a certain journalist, and anothera quiet, shy man witha beardwhom I didnt know, and who, as far as my observation went,never opened his mouth all the evening. There was some speculation atthe dinner-table about the Time Travellers absence, and I suggestedtime travelling, in a half-jocular spirit. The Editor wanted thatexplained to him, and the Psychologist volunteered a wooden account ofthe ingenious paradox and trick we had witnessed that day week. Hewas in the midst of his exposition when the door from the corridoropened slowly and without noise. I was facing the door, and saw itfirst. Hallo! I said. At last! And the door opened wider, and theTime Traveller stood before us. I gave a cry of surprise. Goodheavens! man, whats the matter? cried the Medical Man, who saw himnext. And the whole tableful turned towards the door.He was in an amazing plight. His coat was dusty and dirty, and smearedwith green down the sleeves; his hair disordered, and as it seemed tome greyereither with dust and dirt or because its colour had actuallyfaded. His face was ghastly pale; his chin had a brown cut on ita cuthalf-healed; his expression was haggard and drawn, as by intensesuffering. For a moment he hesitated in the doorway, as if he had beendazzled by the light. Then he came into the room. He walked with justsuch a limp as I have seen in footsore tramps. We stared at him insilence, expecting him to speak.He said not a word, but came painfully to the table, and made a motiontowards the wine. The Editor filled a glass of champagne, and pushed ittowards him. He drained it, and it seemed to do him good: for he lookedround the table, and the ghost of his old smile flickered across hisface. What on earth have you been up to, man? said the Doctor. TheTime Traveller did not seem to hear. Dont let me disturb you, hesaid, with a certain faltering articulation. Im all right. Hestopped, held out his glass for more, and took it off at a draught.Thats good, he said. His eyes grew brighter, and a faint colour cameinto his cheeks. His glance flickered over our faces with a certaindull approval, and then went round the warm and comfortable room. Thenhe spoke again, still as it were feeling his way among his words. Imgoing to wash and dress, and then Ill come down and explain things....Save me some of that mutton. Im starving for a bit of meat.He looked across at the Editor, who was a rare visitor, and hoped hewas all right. The Editor began a question. Tell you presently, saidthe Time Traveller. Imfunny! Be all right in a minute.He put down his glass, and walked towards the staircase door. Again Iremarked his lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall, andstanding up in my place, I saw his feet as he went out. He had nothingon them but a pair of tattered, blood-stained socks. Then the doorclosed upon him. I had half a mind to follow, till I remembered how hedetested any fuss about himself. For a minute, perhaps, my mind waswool-gathering. Then, Remarkable Behaviour of an Eminent Scientist, Iheard the Editor say, thinking (after his wont) in headlines. And thisbrought my attention back to the bright dinner-table.Whats the game? said the Journalist. Has he been doing the AmateurCadger? I dont follow. I met the eye of the Psychologist, and read myown interpretation in his face. I thought of the Time Traveller limpingpainfully upstairs. I dont think anyone else had noticed his lameness.The first to recover completely from this surprise was the Medical Man,who rang the bellthe Time Traveller hated to have servants waiting atdinnerfor a hot plate. At that the Editor turned to his knife and forkwith a grunt, and the Silent Man followed suit. The dinner was resumed.Conversation was exclamatory for a little while with gaps ofwonderment; and then the Editor got fervent in his curiosity. Does ourfriend eke out his modest income with a crossing? or has he hisNebuchadnezzar phases? he inquired. I feel assured its this businessof the Time Machine, I said, and took up the Psychologists account ofour previous meeting. The new guests were frankly incredulous. TheEditor raised objections. What was this time travelling? A mancouldnt cover himself with dust by rolling in a paradox, could he?And then, as the idea came home to him, he resorted to caricature.Hadnt they any clothes-brushes in the Future? The Journalist too,would not believe at any price, and joined the Editor in the easy workof heaping ridicule on the whole thing. They were both the new kind ofjournalistvery joyous, irreverent young men. Our SpecialCorrespondent in the Day after Tomorrow reports, the Journalist wassayingor rather shoutingwhen the Time Traveller came back. He wasdressed in ordinary evening clothes, and nothing save his haggard lookremained of the change that had startled me.I say, said the Editor hilariously, these chaps here say you havebeen travelling into the middle of next week! Tell us all about littleRosebery, will you? What will you take for the lot?The Time Traveller came to the place reserved for him without a word.He smiled quietly, in his old way. Wheres my mutton? he said. Whata treat it is to stick a fork into meat again!Story! cried the Editor.Story be damned! said the Time Traveller. I want something to eat. Iwont say a word until I get some peptone into my arteries. Thanks. Andthe salt.One word, said I. Have you been time travelling?Yes, said the Time Traveller, with his mouth full, nodding his head.Id give a shilling a line for a verbatim note, said the Editor. TheTime Traveller pushed his glass towards the Silent Man and rang it withhis fingernail; at which the Silent Man, who had been staring at hisface, started convulsively, and poured him wine. The rest of the dinnerwas uncomfortable. For my own part, sudden questions kept on rising tomy lips, and I dare say it was the same with the others. The Journalisttried to relieve the tension by telling anecdotes of Hettie Potter. TheTime Traveller devoted his attention to his dinner, and displayed theappetite of a tramp. The Medical Man smoked a cigarette, and watchedthe Time Traveller through his eyelashes. The Silent Man seemed evenmore clumsy than usual, and drank champagne with regularity anddetermination out of sheer nervousness. At last the Time Travellerpushed his plate away, and looked round us. I suppose I mustapologise, he said. I was simply starving. Ive had a most amazingtime. He reached out his hand for a cigar, and cut the end. But comeinto the smoking-room. Its too long a story to tell over greasyplates. And ringing the bell in passing, he led the way into theadjoining room.You have told Blank, and Dash, and Chose about the machine? he saidto me, leaning back in his easy-chair and naming the three new guests.But the things a mere paradox, said the Editor.I cant argue tonight. I dont mind telling you the story, but I cantargue. I will, he went on, tell you the story of what has happened tome, if you like, but you must refrain from interruptions. I want totell it. Badly. Most of it will sound like lying. So be it! Itstrueevery word of it, all the same. I was in my laboratory at fouroclock, and since then â\\x80¦ Ive lived eight days â\\x80¦ such days as no humanbeing ever lived before! Im nearly worn out, but I shant sleep tillIve told this thing over to you. Then I shall go to bed. But nointerruptions! Is it agreed?Agreed, said the Editor, and the rest of us echoed Agreed. And withthat the Time Traveller began his story as I have set it forth. He satback in his chair at first, and spoke like a weary man. Afterwards hegot more animated. In writing it down I feel with only too muchkeenness the inadequacy of pen and inkand, above all, my owninadequacyto express its quality. You read, I will suppose,attentively enough; but you cannot see the speakers white, sincereface in the bright circle of the little lamp, nor hear the intonationof his voice. You cannot know how his expression followed the turns ofhis story! Most of us hearers were in shadow, for the candles in thesmoking-room had not been lighted, and only the face of the Journalistand the legs of the Silent Man from the knees downward wereilluminated. At first we glanced now and again at each other. After atime we ceased to do that, and looked only at the Time Travellersface. IV. Time TravellingI told some of you last Thursday of the principles of the TimeMachine, and showed you the actual thing itself, incomplete in theworkshop. There it is now, a little travel-worn, truly; and one of theivory bars is cracked, and a brass rail bent; but the rest of itssound enough. I expected to finish it on Friday; but on Friday, whenthe putting together was nearly done, I found that one of the nickelbars was exactly one inch too short, and this I had to get remade; sothat the thing was not complete until this morning. It was at tenoclock today that the first of all Time Machines began its career. Igave it a last tap, tried all the screws again, put one more drop ofoil on the quartz rod, and sat myself in the saddle. I suppose asuicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels much the same wonder atwhat will come next as I felt then. I took the starting lever in onehand and the stopping one in the other, pressed the first, and almostimmediately the second. I seemed to reel; I felt a nightmare sensationof falling; and, looking round, I saw the laboratory exactly as before.Had anything happened? For a moment I suspected that my intellect hadtricked me. Then I noted the clock. A moment before, as it seemed, ithad stood at a minute or so past ten; now it was nearly half-pastthree!I drew a breath, set my teeth, gripped the starting lever with bothhands, and went off with a thud. The laboratory got hazy and went dark.Mrs. Watchett came in and walked, apparently without seeing me, towardsthe garden door. I suppose it took her a minute or so to traverse theplace, but to me she seemed to shoot across the room like a rocket. Ipressed the lever over to its extreme position. The night came like theturning out of a lamp, and in another moment came tomorrow. Thelaboratory grew faint and hazy, then fainter and ever fainter. Tomorrownight came black, then day again, night again, day again, faster andfaster still. An eddying murmur filled my ears, and a strange, dumbconfusedness descended on my mind.I am afraid I cannot convey the peculiar sensations of timetravelling. They are excessively unpleasant. There is a feeling exactlylike that one has upon a switchbackof a helpless headlong motion! Ifelt the same horrible anticipation, too, of an imminent smash. As Iput on pace, night followed day like the flapping of a black wing. Thedim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to fall away from me,and I saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky, leaping it everyminute, and every minute marking a day. I supposed the laboratory hadbeen destroyed and I had come into the open air. I had a dim impressionof scaffolding, but I was already going too fast to be conscious of anymoving things. The slowest snail that ever crawled dashed by too fastfor me. The twinkling succession of darkness and light was excessivelypainful to the eye. Then, in the intermittent darknesses, I saw themoon spinning swiftly through her quarters from new to full, and had afaint glimpse of the circling stars. Presently, as I went on, stillgaining velocity, the palpitation of night and day merged into onecontinuous greyness; the sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue, asplendid luminous colour like that of early twilight; the jerking sunbecame a streak of fire, a brilliant arch, in space; the moon a fainterfluctuating band; and I could see nothing of the stars, save now andthen a brighter circle flickering in the blue.The landscape was misty and vague. I was still on the hillside uponwhich this house now stands, and the shoulder rose above me grey anddim. I saw trees growing and changing like puffs of vapour, now brown,now green; they grew, spread, shivered, and passed away. I saw hugebuildings rise up faint and fair, and pass like dreams. The wholesurface of the earth seemed changedmelting and flowing under my eyes.The little hands upon the dials that registered my speed raced roundfaster and faster. Presently I noted that the sun belt swayed up anddown, from solstice to solstice, in a minute or less, and thatconsequently my pace was over a year a minute; and minute by minute thewhite snow flashed across the world, and vanished, and was followed bythe bright, brief green of spring.The unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now. Theymerged at last into a kind of hysterical exhilaration. I remarked,indeed, a clumsy swaying of the machine, for which I was unable toaccount. But my mind was too confused to attend to it, so with a kindof madness growing upon me, I flung myself into futurity. At first Iscarce thought of stopping, scarce thought of anything but these newsensations. But presently a fresh series of impressions grew up in myminda certain curiosity and therewith a certain dreaduntil at lastthey took complete possession of me. What strange developments ofhumanity, what wonderful advances upon our rudimentary civilisation, Ithought, might not appear when I came to look nearly into the dimelusive world that raced and fluctuated before my eyes! I saw great andsplendid architecture rising about me, more massive than any buildingsof our own time, and yet, as it seemed, built of glimmer and mist. Isaw a richer green flow up the hillside, and remain there, without anywintry intermission. Even through the veil of my confusion the earthseemed very fair. And so my mind came round to the business ofstopping.The peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding some substancein the space which I, or the machine, occupied. So long as I travelledat a high velocity through time, this scarcely mattered: I was, so tospeak, attenuatedwas slipping like a vapour through the interstices ofintervening substances! But to come to a stop involved the jamming ofmyself, molecule by molecule, into whatever lay in my way; meantbringing my atoms into such intimate contact with those of the obstaclethat a profound chemical reactionpossibly a far-reachingexplosionwould result, and blow myself and my apparatus out of allpossible dimensionsinto the Unknown. This possibility had occurred tome again and again while I was making the machine; but then I hadcheerfully accepted it as an unavoidable riskone of the risks a manhas got to take! Now the risk was inevitable, I no longer saw it in thesame cheerful light. The fact is that, insensibly, the absolutestrangeness of everything, the sickly jarring and swaying of themachine, above all, the feeling of prolonged falling, had absolutelyupset my nerves. I told myself that I could never stop, and with a gustof petulance I resolved to stop forthwith. Like an impatient fool, Ilugged over the lever, and incontinently the thing went reeling over,and I was flung headlong through the air.There was the sound of a clap of thunder in my ears. I may have beenstunned for a moment. A pitiless hail was hissing round me, and I wassitting on soft turf in front of the overset machine. Everything stillseemed grey, but presently I remarked that the confusion in my ears wasgone. I looked round me. I was on what seemed to be a little lawn in agarden, surrounded by rhododendron bushes, and I noticed that theirmauve and purple blossoms were dropping in a shower under the beatingof the hailstones. The rebounding, dancing hail hung in a little cloudover the machine, and drove along the ground like smoke. In a moment Iwas wet to the skin. Fine hospitality, said I, to a man who hastravelled innumerable years to see you.Presently I thought what a fool I was to get wet. I stood up andlooked round me. A colossal figure, carved apparently in some whitestone, loomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the hazydownpour. But all else of the world was invisible.My sensations would be hard to describe. As the columns of hail grewthinner, I saw the white figure more distinctly. It was very large, fora silver birch-tree touched its shoulder. It was of white marble, inshape something like a winged sphinx, but the wings, instead of beingcarried vertically at the sides, were spread so that it seemed tohover. The pedestal, it appeared to me, was of bronze, and was thickwith verdigris. It chanced that the face was towards me; the sightlesseyes seemed to watch me; there was the faint shadow of a smile on thelips. It was greatly weather-worn, and that imparted an unpleasantsuggestion of disease. I stood looking at it for a little spacehalf aminute, perhaps, or half an hour. It seemed to advance and to recede asthe hail drove before it denser or thinner. At last I tore my eyes fromit for a moment, and saw that the hail curtain had worn threadbare, andthat the sky was lightening with the promise of the sun.I looked up again at the crouching white shape, and the full temerityof my voyage came suddenly upon me. What might appear when that hazycurtain was altogether withdrawn? What might not have happened to men?What if cruelty had grown into a common passion? What if in thisinterval the race had lost its manliness, and had developed intosomething inhuman, unsympathetic, and overwhelmingly powerful? I mightseem some old-world savage animal, only the more dreadful anddisgusting for our common likenessa foul creature to be incontinentlyslain.Already I saw other vast shapeshuge buildings with intricate parapetsand tall columns, with a wooded hillside dimly creeping in upon methrough the lessening storm. I was seized with a panic fear. I turnedfrantically to the Time Machine, and strove hard to readjust it. As Idid so the shafts of the sun smote through the thunderstorm. The greydownpour was swept aside and vanished like the trailing garments of aghost. Above me, in the intense blue of the summer sky, some faintbrown shreds of cloud whirled into nothingness. The great buildingsabout me stood out clear and distinct, shining with the wet of thethunderstorm, and picked out in white by the unmelted hailstones piledalong their courses. I felt naked in a strange world. I felt as perhapsa bird may feel in the clear air, knowing the hawk wings above and willswoop. My fear grew to frenzy. I took a breathing space, set my teeth,and again grappled fiercely, wrist and knee, with the machine. It gaveunder my desperate onset and turned over. It struck my chin violently.One hand on the saddle, the other on the lever, I stood panting heavilyin attitude to mount again.But with this recovery of a prompt retreat my courage recovered. Ilooked more curiously and less fearfully at this world of the remotefuture. In a circular opening, high up in the wall of the nearer house,I saw a group of figures clad in rich soft robes. They had seen me, andtheir faces were directed towards me.Then I heard voices approaching me. Coming through the bushes by theWhite Sphinx were the heads and shoulders of men running. One of theseemerged in a pathway leading straight to the little lawn upon which Istood with my machine. He was a slight creatureperhaps four feethighclad in a purple tunic, girdled at the waist with a leather belt.Sandals or buskinsI could not clearly distinguish whichwere on hisfeet; his legs were bare to the knees, and his head was bare. Noticingthat, I noticed for the first time how warm the air was.He struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature, butindescribably frail. His flushed face reminded me of the more beautifulkind of consumptivethat hectic beauty of which we used to hear somuch. At the sight of him I suddenly regained confidence. I took myhands from the machine. V. In the Golden AgeIn another moment we were standing face to face, I and this fragilething out of futurity. He came straight up to me and laughed into myeyes. The absence from his bearing of any sign of fear struck me atonce. Then he turned to the two others who were following him and spoketo them in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongue.There were others coming, and presently a little group of perhapseight or ten of these exquisite creatures were about me. One of themaddressed me. It came into my head, oddly enough, that my voice was tooharsh and deep for them. So I shook my head, and, pointing to my ears,shook it again. He came a step forward, hesitated, and then touched myhand. Then I felt other soft little tentacles upon my back andshoulders. They wanted to make sure I was real. There was nothing inthis at all alarming. Indeed, there was something in these prettylittle people that inspired confidencea graceful gentleness, a certainchildlike ease. And besides, they looked so frail that I could fancymyself flinging the whole dozen of them about like ninepins. But I madea sudden motion to warn them when I saw their little pink hands feelingat the Time Machine. Happily then, when it was not too late, I thoughtof a danger I had hitherto forgotten, and reaching over the bars of themachine I unscrewed the little levers that would set it in motion, andput these in my pocket. Then I turned again to see what I could do inthe way of communication.And then, looking more nearly into their features, I saw some furtherpeculiarities in their Dresden china type of prettiness. Their hair,which was uniformly curly, came to a sharp end at the neck and cheek;there was not the faintest suggestion of it on the face, and their earswere singularly minute. The mouths were small, with bright red, ratherthin lips, and the little chins ran to a point. The eyes were large andmild; andthis may seem egotism on my partI fancied even that therewas a certain lack of the interest I might have expected in them.As they made no effort to communicate with me, but simply stood roundme smiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other, I began theconversation. I pointed to the Time Machine and to myself. Then,hesitating for a moment how to express Time, I pointed to the sun. Atonce a quaintly pretty little figure in chequered purple and whitefollowed my gesture, and then astonished me by imitating the sound ofthunder.For a moment I was staggered, though the import of his gesture wasplain enough. The question had come into my mind abruptly: were thesecreatures fools? You may hardly understand how it took me. You see, Ihad always anticipated that the people of the year Eight Hundred andTwo Thousand odd would be incredibly in front of us in knowledge, art,everything. Then one of them suddenly asked me a question that showedhim to be on the intellectual level of one of our five-year-oldchildrenasked me, in fact, if I had come from the sun in athunderstorm! It let loose the judgment I had suspended upon theirclothes, their frail light limbs, and fragile features. A flow ofdisappointment rushed across my mind. For a moment I felt that I hadbuilt the Time Machine in vain.I nodded, pointed to the sun, and gave them such a vivid rendering ofa thunderclap as startled them. They all withdrew a pace or so andbowed. Then came one laughing towards me, carrying a chain of beautifulflowers altogether new to me, and put it about my neck. The idea wasreceived with melodious applause; and presently they were all runningto and fro for flowers, and laughingly flinging them upon me until Iwas almost smothered with blossom. You who have never seen the like canscarcely imagine what delicate and wonderful flowers countless years ofculture had created. Then someone suggested that their plaything shouldbe exhibited in the nearest building, and so I was led past the sphinxof white marble, which had seemed to watch me all the while with asmile at my astonishment, towards a vast grey edifice of fretted stone.As I went with them the memory of my confident anticipations of aprofoundly grave and intellectual posterity came, with irresistiblemerriment, to my mind.The building had a huge entry, and was altogether of colossaldimensions. I was naturally most occupied with the growing crowd oflittle people, and with the big open portals that yawned before meshadowy and mysterious. My general impression of the world I saw overtheir heads was a tangled waste of beautiful bushes and flowers, a longneglected and yet weedless garden. I saw a number of tall spikes ofstrange white flowers, measuring a foot perhaps across the spread ofthe waxen petals. They grew scattered, as if wild, among the variegatedshrubs, but, as I say, I did not examine them closely at this time. TheTime Machine was left deserted on the turf among the rhododendrons.The arch of the doorway was richly carved, but naturally I did notobserve the carving very narrowly, though I fancied I saw suggestionsof old PhÅ\\x93nician decorations as I passed through, and it struck me thatthey were very badly broken and weather-worn. Several more brightlyclad people met me in the doorway, and so we entered, I, dressed indingy nineteenth-century garments, looking grotesque enough, garlandedwith flowers, and surrounded by an eddying mass of bright,soft-coloured robes and shining white limbs, in a melodious whirl oflaughter and laughing speech.The big doorway opened into a proportionately great hall hung withbrown. The roof was in shadow, and the windows, partially glazed withcoloured glass and partially unglazed, admitted a tempered light. Thefloor was made up of huge blocks of some very hard white metal, notplates nor slabsblocks, and it was so much worn, as I judged by thegoing to and fro of past generations, as to be deeply channelled alongthe more frequented ways. Transverse to the length were innumerabletables made of slabs of polished stone, raised, perhaps, a foot fromthe floor, and upon these were heaps of fruits. Some I recognised as akind of hypertrophied raspberry and orange, but for the most part theywere strange.Between the tables was scattered a great number of cushions. Uponthese my conductors seated themselves, signing for me to do likewise.With a pretty absence of ceremony they began to eat the fruit withtheir hands, flinging peel and stalks, and so forth, into the roundopenings in the sides of the tables. I was not loath to follow theirexample, for I felt thirsty and hungry. As I did so I surveyed the hallat my leisure.And perhaps the thing that struck me most was its dilapidated look.The stained-glass windows, which displayed only a geometrical pattern,were broken in many places, and the curtains that hung across the lowerend were thick with dust. And it caught my eye that the corner of themarble table near me was fractured. Nevertheless, the general effectwas extremely rich and picturesque. There were, perhaps, a couple ofhundred people dining in the hall, and most of them, seated as near tome as they could come, were watching me with interest, their littleeyes shining over the fruit they were eating. All were clad in the samesoft, and yet strong, silky material.Fruit, by the bye, was all their diet. These people of the remotefuture were strict vegetarians, and while I was with them, in spite ofsome carnal cravings, I had to be frugivorous also. Indeed, I foundafterwards that horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, had followed theIchthyosaurus into extinction. But the fruits were very delightful;one, in particular, that seemed to be in season all the time I wastherea floury thing in a three-sided huskwas especially good, and Imade it my staple. At first I was puzzled by all these strange fruits,and by the strange flowers I saw, but later I began to perceive theirimport.However, I am telling you of my fruit dinner in the distant futurenow. So soon as my appetite was a little checked, I determined to makea resolute attempt to learn the speech of these new men of mine.Clearly that was the next thing to do. The fruits seemed a convenientthing to begin upon, and holding one of these up I began a series ofinterrogative sounds and gestures. I had some considerable difficultyin conveying my meaning. At first my efforts met with a stare ofsurprise or inextinguishable laughter, but presently a fair-hairedlittle creature seemed to grasp my intention and repeated a name. Theyhad to chatter and explain the business at great length to each other,and my first attempts to make the exquisite little sounds of theirlanguage caused an immense amount of genuine, if uncivil, amusement.However, I felt like a schoolmaster amidst children, and persisted, andpresently I had a score of noun substantives at least at my command;and then I got to demonstrative pronouns, and even the verb to eat.But it was slow work, and the little people soon tired and wanted toget away from my interrogations, so I determined, rather of necessity,to let them give their lessons in little doses when they felt inclined.And very little doses I found they were before long, for I never metpeople more indolent or more easily fatigued. VI. The Sunset of MankindA queer thing I soon discovered about my little hosts, and that wastheir lack of interest. They would come to me with eager cries ofastonishment, like children, but, like children they would soon stopexamining me, and wander away after some other toy. The dinner and myconversational beginnings ended, I noted for the first time that almostall those who had surrounded me at first were gone. It is odd, too, howspeedily I came to disregard these little people. I went out throughthe portal into the sunlit world again as soon as my hunger wassatisfied. I was continually meeting more of these men of the future,who would follow me a little distance, chatter and laugh about me, and,having smiled and gesticulated in a friendly way, leave me again to myown devices.The calm of evening was upon the world as I emerged from the greathall, and the scene was lit by the warm glow of the setting sun. Atfirst things were very confusing. Everything was so entirely differentfrom the world I had knowneven the flowers. The big building I hadleft was situated on the slope of a broad river valley, but the Thameshad shifted, perhaps, a mile from its present position. I resolved tomount to the summit of a crest, perhaps a mile and a half away, fromwhich I could get a wider view of this our planet in the year EightHundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred and One, A.D. For that, I shouldexplain, was the date the little dials of my machine recorded.As I walked I was watching for every impression that could possiblyhelp to explain the condition of ruinous splendour in which I found theworldfor ruinous it was. A little way up the hill, for instance, was agreat heap of granite, bound together by masses of aluminium, a vastlabyrinth of precipitous walls and crumpled heaps, amidst which werethick heaps of very beautiful pagoda-like plantsnettles possiblybutwonderfully tinted with brown about the leaves, and incapable ofstinging. It was evidently the derelict remains of some vast structure,to what end built I could not determine. It was here that I wasdestined, at a later date, to have a very strange experiencethe firstintimation of a still stranger discoverybut of that I will speak inits proper place.Looking round, with a sudden thought, from a terrace on which I restedfor a while, I realised that there were no small houses to be seen.Apparently the single house, and possibly even the household, hadvanished. Here and there among the greenery were palace-like buildings,but the house and the cottage, which form such characteristic featuresof our own English landscape, had disappeared.Communism, said I to myself.And on the heels of that came another thought. I looked at thehalf-dozen little figures that were following me. Then, in a flash, Iperceived that all had the same form of costume, the same soft hairlessvisage, and the same girlish rotundity of limb. It may seem strange,perhaps, that I had not noticed this before. But everything was sostrange. Now, I saw the fact plainly enough. In costume, and in all thedifferences of texture and bearing that now mark off the sexes fromeach other, these people of the future were alike. And the childrenseemed to my eyes to be but the miniatures of their parents. I judgedthen that the children of that time were extremely precocious,physically at least, and I found afterwards abundant verification of myopinion.Seeing the ease and security in which these people were living, I feltthat this close resemblance of the sexes was after all what one wouldexpect; for the strength of a man and the softness of a woman, theinstitution of the family, and the differentiation of occupations aremere militant necessities of an age of physical force. Where populationis balanced and abundant, much childbearing becomes an evil rather thana blessing to the State; where violence comes but rarely and offspringare secure, there is less necessityindeed there is no necessityfor anefficient family, and the specialisation of the sexes with reference totheir childrens needs disappears. We see some beginnings of this evenin our own time, and in this future age it was complete. This, I mustremind you, was my speculation at the time. Later, I was to appreciatehow far it fell short of the reality.While I was musing upon these things, my attention was attracted by apretty little structure, like a well under a cupola. I thought in atransitory way of the oddness of wells still existing, and then resumedthe thread of my speculations. There were no large buildings towardsthe top of the hill, and as my walking powers were evidentlymiraculous, I was presently left alone for the first time. With astrange sense of freedom and adventure I pushed on up to the crest.There I found a seat of some yellow metal that I did not recognise,corroded in places with a kind of pinkish rust and half smothered insoft moss, the arm-rests cast and filed into the resemblance ofgriffins heads. I sat down on it, and I surveyed the broad view of ourold world under the sunset of that long day. It was as sweet and fair aview as I have ever seen. The sun had already gone below the horizonand the west was flaming gold, touched with some horizontal bars ofpurple and crimson. Below was the valley of the Thames, in which theriver lay like a band of burnished steel. I have already spoken of thegreat palaces dotted about among the variegated greenery, some in ruinsand some still occupied. Here and there rose a white or silvery figurein the waste garden of the earth, here and there came the sharpvertical line of some cupola or obelisk. There were no hedges, no signsof proprietary rights, no evidences of agriculture; the whole earth hadbecome a garden.So watching, I began to put my interpretation upon the things I hadseen, and as it shaped itself to me that evening, my interpretation wassomething in this way. (Afterwards I found I had got only a halftruthor only a glimpse of one facet of the truth.)It seemed to me that I had happened upon humanity upon the wane. Theruddy sunset set me thinking of the sunset of mankind. For the firsttime I began to realise an odd consequence of the social effort inwhich we are at present engaged. And yet, come to think, it is alogical consequence enough. Strength is the outcome of need; securitysets a premium on feebleness. The work of ameliorating the conditionsof lifethe true civilising process that makes life more and moresecurehad gone steadily on to a climax. One triumph of a unitedhumanity over Nature had followed another. Things that are now meredreams had become projects deliberately put in hand and carriedforward. And the harvest was what I saw!After all, the sanitation and the agriculture of today are still inthe rudimentary stage. The science of our time has attacked but alittle department of the field of human disease, but, even so, itspreads its operations very steadily and persistently. Our agricultureand horticulture destroy a weed just here and there and cultivateperhaps a score or so of wholesome plants, leaving the greater numberto fight out a balance as they can. We improve our favourite plants andanimalsand how few they aregradually by selective breeding; now a newand better peach, now a seedless grape, now a sweeter and largerflower, now a more convenient breed of cattle. We improve themgradually, because our ideals are vague and tentative, and ourknowledge is very limited; because Nature, too, is shy and slow in ourclumsy hands. Some day all this will be better organised, and stillbetter. That is the drift of the current in spite of the eddies. Thewhole world will be intelligent, educated, and co-operating; thingswill move faster and faster towards the subjugation of Nature. In theend, wisely and carefully we shall readjust the balance of animal andvegetable life to suit our human needs.This adjustment, I say, must have been done, and done well; doneindeed for all Time, in the space of Time across which my machine hadleapt. The air was free from gnats, the earth from weeds or fungi;everywhere were fruits and sweet and delightful flowers; brilliantbutterflies flew hither and thither. The ideal of preventive medicinewas attained. Diseases had been stamped out. I saw no evidence of anycontagious diseases during all my stay. And I shall have to tell youlater that even the processes of putrefaction and decay had beenprofoundly affected by these changes.Social triumphs, too, had been effected. I saw mankind housed insplendid shelters, gloriously clothed, and as yet I had found themengaged in no toil. There were no signs of struggle, neither social noreconomical struggle. The shop, the advertisement, traffic, all thatcommerce which constitutes the body of our world, was gone. It wasnatural on that golden evening that I should jump at the idea of asocial paradise. The difficulty of increasing population had been met,I guessed, and population had ceased to increase.But with this change in condition comes inevitably adaptations to thechange. What, unless biological science is a mass of errors, is thecause of human intelligence and vigour? Hardship and freedom:conditions under which the active, strong, and subtle survive and theweaker go to the wall; conditions that put a premium upon the loyalalliance of capable men, upon self-restraint, patience, and decision.And the institution of the family, and the emotions that arise therein,the fierce jealousy, the tenderness for offspring, parentalself-devotion, all found their justification and support in theimminent dangers of the young. Now, where are these imminent dangers?There is a sentiment arising, and it will grow, against connubialjealousy, against fierce maternity, against passion of all sorts;unnecessary things now, and things that make us uncomfortable, savagesurvivals, discords in a refined and pleasant life.I thought of the physical slightness of the people, their lack ofintelligence, and those big abundant ruins, and it strengthened mybelief in a perfect conquest of Nature. For after the battle comesQuiet. Humanity had been strong, energetic, and intelligent, and hadused all its abundant vitality to alter the conditions under which itlived. And now came the reaction of the altered conditions.Under the new conditions of perfect comfort and security, thatrestless energy, that with us is strength, would become weakness. Evenin our own time certain tendencies and desires, once necessary tosurvival, are a constant source of failure. Physical courage and thelove of battle, for instance, are no great helpmay even behindrancesto a civilised man. And in a state of physical balance andsecurity, power, intellectual as well as physical, would be out ofplace. For countless years I judged there had been no danger of war orsolitary violence, no danger from wild beasts, no wasting disease torequire strength of constitution, no need of toil. For such a life,what we should call the weak are as well equipped as the strong, areindeed no longer weak. Better equipped indeed they are, for the strongwould be fretted by an energy for which there was no outlet. No doubtthe exquisite beauty of the buildings I saw was the outcome of the lastsurgings of the now purposeless energy of mankind before it settleddown into perfect harmony with the conditions under which it livedtheflourish of that triumph which began the last great peace. This hasever been the fate of energy in security; it takes to art and toeroticism, and then come languor and decay.Even this artistic impetus would at last die awayhad almost died inthe Time I saw. To adorn themselves with flowers, to dance, to sing inthe sunlight: so much was left of the artistic spirit, and no more.Even that would fade in the end into a contented inactivity. We arekept keen on the grindstone of pain and necessity, and it seemed to methat here was that hateful grindstone broken at last!As I stood there in the gathering dark I thought that in this simpleexplanation I had mastered the problem of the worldmastered the wholesecret of these delicious people. Possibly the checks they had devisedfor the increase of population had succeeded too well, and theirnumbers had rather diminished than kept stationary. That would accountfor the abandoned ruins. Very simple was my explanation, and plausibleenoughas most wrong theories are! VII. A Sudden ShockAs I stood there musing over this too perfect triumph of man, the fullmoon, yellow and gibbous, came up out of an overflow of silver light inthe north-east. The bright little figures ceased to move about below, anoiseless owl flitted by, and I shivered with the chill of the night. Idetermined to descend and find where I could sleep.I looked for the building I knew. Then my eye travelled along to thefigure of the White Sphinx upon the pedestal of bronze, growingdistinct as the light of the rising moon grew brighter. I could see thesilver birch against it. There was the tangle of rhododendron bushes,black in the pale light, and there was the little lawn. I looked at thelawn again. A queer doubt chilled my complacency. No, said I stoutlyto myself, that was not the lawn.But it was the lawn. For the white leprous face of the sphinx wastowards it. Can you imagine what I felt as this conviction came home tome? But you cannot. The Time Machine was gone!At once, like a lash across the face, came the possibility of losingmy own age, of being left helpless in this strange new world. The barethought of it was an actual physical sensation. I could feel it grip meat the throat and stop my breathing. In another moment I was in apassion of fear and running with great leaping strides down the slope.Once I fell headlong and cut my face; I lost no time in stanching theblood, but jumped up and ran on, with a warm trickle down my cheek andchin. All the time I ran I was saying to myself: They have moved it alittle, pushed it under the bushes out of the way. Nevertheless, I ranwith all my might. All the time, with the certainty that sometimescomes with excessive dread, I knew that such assurance was folly, knewinstinctively that the machine was removed out of my reach. My breathcame with pain. I suppose I covered the whole distance from the hillcrest to the little lawn, two miles perhaps, in ten minutes. And I amnot a young man. I cursed aloud, as I ran, at my confident folly inleaving the machine, wasting good breath thereby. I cried aloud, andnone answered. Not a creature seemed to be stirring in that moonlitworld.When I reached the lawn my worst fears were realised. Not a trace ofthe thing was to be seen. I felt faint and cold when I faced the emptyspace among the black tangle of bushes. I ran round it furiously, as ifthe thing might be hidden in a corner, and then stopped abruptly, withmy hands clutching my hair. Above me towered the sphinx, upon thebronze pedestal, white, shining, leprous, in the light of the risingmoon. It seemed to smile in mockery of my dismay.I might have consoled myself by imagining the little people had putthe mechanism in some shelter for me, had I not felt assured of theirphysical and intellectual inadequacy. That is what dismayed me: thesense of some hitherto unsuspected power, through whose intervention myinvention had vanished. Yet, for one thing I felt assured: unless someother age had produced its exact duplicate, the machine could not havemoved in time. The attachment of the leversI will show you the methodlaterprevented anyone from tampering with it in that way when theywere removed. It had moved, and was hid, only in space. But then, wherecould it be?I think I must have had a kind of frenzy. I remember running violentlyin and out among the moonlit bushes all round the sphinx, and startlingsome white animal that, in the dim light, I took for a small deer. Iremember, too, late that night, beating the bushes with my clenchedfist until my knuckles were gashed and bleeding from the broken twigs.Then, sobbing and raving in my anguish of mind, I went down to thegreat building of stone. The big hall was dark, silent, and deserted. Islipped on the uneven floor, and fell over one of the malachite tables,almost breaking my shin. I lit a match and went on past the dustycurtains, of which I have told you.There I found a second great hall covered with cushions, upon which,perhaps, a score or so of the little people were sleeping. I have nodoubt they found my second appearance strange enough, coming suddenlyout of the quiet darkness with inarticulate noises and the splutter andflare of a match. For they had forgotten about matches. Where is myTime Machine? I began, bawling like an angry child, laying hands uponthem and shaking them up together. It must have been very queer tothem. Some laughed, most of them looked sorely frightened. When I sawthem standing round me, it came into my head that I was doing asfoolish a thing as it was possible for me to do under thecircumstances, in trying to revive the sensation of fear. For,reasoning from their daylight behaviour, I thought that fear must beforgotten.Abruptly, I dashed down the match, and knocking one of the people overin my course, went blundering across the big dining-hall again, outunder the moonlight. I heard cries of terror and their little feetrunning and stumbling this way and that. I do not remember all I did asthe moon crept up the sky. I suppose it was the unexpected nature of myloss that maddened me. I felt hopelessly cut off from my own kindastrange animal in an unknown world. I must have raved to and fro,screaming and crying upon God and Fate. I have a memory of horriblefatigue, as the long night of despair wore away; of looking in thisimpossible place and that; of groping among moonlit ruins and touchingstrange creatures in the black shadows; at last, of lying on the groundnear the sphinx and weeping with absolute wretchedness, even anger atthe folly of leaving the machine having leaked away with my strength. Ihad nothing left but misery. Then I slept, and when I woke again it wasfull day, and a couple of sparrows were hopping round me on the turfwithin reach of my arm.I sat up in the freshness of the morning, trying to remember how I hadgot there, and why I had such a profound sense of desertion anddespair. Then things came clear in my mind. With the plain, reasonabledaylight, I could look my circumstances fairly in the face. I saw thewild folly of my frenzy overnight, and I could reason with myself.Suppose the worst? I said. Suppose the machine altogetherlostperhaps destroyed? It behoves me to be calm and patient, to learnthe way of the people, to get a clear idea of the method of my loss,and the means of getting materials and tools; so that in the end,perhaps, I may make another. That would be my only hope, a poor hope,perhaps, but better than despair. And, after all, it was a beautifuland curious world.But probably the machine had only been taken away. Still, I must becalm and patient, find its hiding-place, and recover it by force orcunning. And with that I scrambled to my feet and looked about me,wondering where I could bathe. I felt weary, stiff, and travel-soiled.The freshness of the morning made me desire an equal freshness. I hadexhausted my emotion. Indeed, as I went about my business, I foundmyself wondering at my intense excitement overnight. I made a carefulexamination of the ground about the little lawn. I wasted some time infutile questionings, conveyed, as well as I was able, to such of thelittle people as came by. They all failed to understand my gestures;some were simply stolid, some thought it was a jest and laughed at me.I had the hardest task in the world to keep my hands off their prettylaughing faces. It was a foolish impulse, but the devil begotten offear and blind anger was ill curbed and still eager to take advantageof my perplexity. The turf gave better counsel. I found a groove rippedin it, about midway between the pedestal of the sphinx and the marks ofmy feet where, on arrival, I had struggled with the overturned machine.There were other signs of removal about, with queer narrow footprintslike those I could imagine made by a sloth. This directed my closerattention to the pedestal. It was, as I think I have said, of bronze.It was not a mere block, but highly decorated with deep framed panelson either side. I went and rapped at these. The pedestal was hollow.Examining the panels with care I found them discontinuous with theframes. There were no handles or keyholes, but possibly the panels, ifthey were doors, as I supposed, opened from within. One thing was clearenough to my mind. It took no very great mental effort to infer that myTime Machine was inside that pedestal. But how it got there was adifferent problem.I saw the heads of two orange-clad people coming through the bushesand under some blossom-covered apple-trees towards me. I turned smilingto them, and beckoned them to me. They came, and then, pointing to thebronze pedestal, I tried to intimate my wish to open it. But at myfirst gesture towards this they behaved very oddly. I dont know how toconvey their expression to you. Suppose you were to use a grosslyimproper gesture to a delicate-minded womanit is how she would look.They went off as if they had received the last possible insult. I trieda sweet-looking little chap in white next, with exactly the sameresult. Somehow, his manner made me feel ashamed of myself. But, as youknow, I wanted the Time Machine, and I tried him once more. As heturned off, like the others, my temper got the better of me. In threestrides I was after him, had him by the loose part of his robe roundthe neck, and began dragging him towards the sphinx. Then I saw thehorror and repugnance of his face, and all of a sudden I let him go.But I was not beaten yet. I banged with my fist at the bronze panels.I thought I heard something stir insideto be explicit, I thought Iheard a sound like a chucklebut I must have been mistaken. Then I gota big pebble from the river, and came and hammered till I had flatteneda coil in the decorations, and the verdigris came off in powderyflakes. The delicate little people must have heard me hammering ingusty outbreaks a mile away on either hand, but nothing came of it. Isaw a crowd of them upon the slopes, looking furtively at me. At last,hot and tired, I sat down to watch the place. But I was too restless towatch long; I am too Occidental for a long vigil. I could work at aproblem for years, but to wait inactive for twenty-four hoursthat isanother matter.I got up after a time, and began walking aimlessly through the bushestowards the hill again. Patience, said I to myself. If you want yourmachine again you must leave that sphinx alone. If they mean to takeyour machine away, its little good your wrecking their bronze panels,and if they dont, you will get it back as soon as you can ask for it.To sit among all those unknown things before a puzzle like that ishopeless. That way lies monomania. Face this world. Learn its ways,watch it, be careful of too hasty guesses at its meaning. In the endyou will find clues to it all. Then suddenly the humour of thesituation came into my mind: the thought of the years I had spent instudy and toil to get into the future age, and now my passion ofanxiety to get out of it. I had made myself the most complicated andthe most hopeless trap that ever a man devised. Although it was at myown expense, I could not help myself. I laughed aloud.Going through the big palace, it seemed to me that the little peopleavoided me. It may have been my fancy, or it may have had something todo with my hammering at the gates of bronze. Yet I felt tolerably sureof the avoidance. I was careful, however, to show no concern and toabstain from any pursuit of them, and in the course of a day or twothings got back to the old footing. I made what progress I could in thelanguage, and in addition I pushed my explorations here and there.Either I missed some subtle point or their language was excessivelysimplealmost exclusively composed of concrete substantives and verbs.There seemed to be few, if any, abstract terms, or little use offigurative language. Their sentences were usually simple and of twowords, and I failed to convey or understand any but the simplestpropositions. I determined to put the thought of my Time Machine andthe mystery of the bronze doors under the sphinx, as much as possiblein a corner of memory, until my growing knowledge would lead me back tothem in a natural way. Yet a certain feeling, you may understand,tethered me in a circle of a few miles round the point of my arrival. VIII. ExplanationSo far as I could see, all the world displayed the same exuberantrichness as the Thames valley. From every hill I climbed I saw the sameabundance of splendid buildings, endlessly varied in material andstyle, the same clustering thickets of evergreens, the sameblossom-laden trees and tree ferns. Here and there water shone likesilver, and beyond, the land rose into blue undulating hills, and sofaded into the serenity of the sky. A peculiar feature, which presentlyattracted my attention, was the presence of certain circular wells,several, as it seemed to me, of a very great depth. One lay by the pathup the hill which I had followed during my first walk. Like the others,it was rimmed with bronze, curiously wrought, and protected by a littlecupola from the rain. Sitting by the side of these wells, and peeringdown into the shafted darkness, I could see no gleam of water, norcould I start any reflection with a lighted match. But in all of them Iheard a certain sound: a thudthudthud, like the beating of some bigengine; and I discovered, from the flaring of my matches, that a steadycurrent of air set down the shafts. Further, I threw a scrap of paperinto the throat of one, and, instead of fluttering slowly down, it wasat once sucked swiftly out of sight.After a time, too, I came to connect these wells with tall towersstanding here and there upon the slopes; for above them there was oftenjust such a flicker in the air as one sees on a hot day above asun-scorched beach. Putting things together, I reached a strongsuggestion of an extensive system of subterranean ventilation, whosetrue import it was difficult to imagine. I was at first inclined toassociate it with the sanitary apparatus of these people. It was anobvious conclusion, but it was absolutely wrong.And here I must admit that I learnt very little of drains and bellsand modes of conveyance, and the like conveniences, during my time inthis real future. In some of these visions of Utopias and coming timeswhich I have read, there is a vast amount of detail about building, andsocial arrangements, and so forth. But while such details are easyenough to obtain when the whole world is contained in onesimagination, they are altogether inaccessible to a real traveller amidsuch realities as I found here. Conceive the tale of London which anegro, fresh from Central Africa, would take back to his tribe! Whatwould he know of railway companies, of social movements, of telephoneand telegraph wires, of the Parcels Delivery Company, and postal ordersand the like? Yet we, at least, should be willing enough to explainthese things to him! And even of what he knew, how much could he makehis untravelled friend either apprehend or believe? Then, think hownarrow the gap between a negro and a white man of our own times, andhow wide the interval between myself and these of the Golden Age! I wassensible of much which was unseen, and which contributed to my comfort;but save for a general impression of automatic organisation, I fear Ican convey very little of the difference to your mind.In the matter of sepulture, for instance, I could see no signs ofcrematoria nor anything suggestive of tombs. But it occurred to methat, possibly, there might be cemeteries (or crematoria) somewherebeyond the range of my explorings. This, again, was a question Ideliberately put to myself, and my curiosity was at first entirelydefeated upon the point. The thing puzzled me, and I was led to make afurther remark, which puzzled me still more: that aged and infirm amongthis people there were none.I must confess that my satisfaction with my first theories of anautomatic civilisation and a decadent humanity did not long endure. YetI could think of no other. Let me put my difficulties. The several bigpalaces I had explored were mere living places, great dining-halls andsleeping apartments. I could find no machinery, no appliances of anykind. Yet these people were clothed in pleasant fabrics that must attimes need renewal, and their sandals, though undecorated, were fairlycomplex specimens of metalwork. Somehow such things must be made. Andthe little people displayed no vestige of a creative tendency. Therewere no shops, no workshops, no sign of importations among them. Theyspent all their time in playing gently, in bathing in the river, inmaking love in a half-playful fashion, in eating fruit and sleeping. Icould not see how things were kept going.Then, again, about the Time Machine: something, I knew not what, hadtaken it into the hollow pedestal of the White Sphinx. Why? For thelife of me I could not imagine. Those waterless wells, too, thoseflickering pillars. I felt I lacked a clue. I felthow shall I put it?Suppose you found an inscription, with sentences here and there inexcellent plain English, and interpolated therewith, others made up ofwords, of letters even, absolutely unknown to you? Well, on the thirdday of my visit, that was how the world of Eight Hundred and TwoThousand Seven Hundred and One presented itself to me!That day, too, I made a friendof a sort. It happened that, as I waswatching some of the little people bathing in a shallow, one of themwas seized with cramp and began drifting downstream. The main currentran rather swiftly, but not too strongly for even a moderate swimmer.It will give you an idea, therefore, of the strange deficiency in thesecreatures, when I tell you that none made the slightest attempt torescue the weakly crying little thing which was drowning before theireyes. When I realised this, I hurriedly slipped off my clothes, and,wading in at a point lower down, I caught the poor mite and drew hersafe to land. A little rubbing of the limbs soon brought her round, andI had the satisfaction of seeing she was all right before I left her. Ihad got to such a low estimate of her kind that I did not expect anygratitude from her. In that, however, I was wrong.This happened in the morning. In the afternoon I met my little woman,as I believe it was, as I was returning towards my centre from anexploration, and she received me with cries of delight and presented mewith a big garland of flowersevidently made for me and me alone. Thething took my imagination. Very possibly I had been feeling desolate.At any rate I did my best to display my appreciation of the gift. Wewere soon seated together in a little stone arbour, engaged inconversation, chiefly of smiles. The creatures friendliness affectedme exactly as a childs might have done. We passed each other flowers,and she kissed my hands. I did the same to hers. Then I tried talk, andfound that her name was Weena, which, though I dont know what itmeant, somehow seemed appropriate enough. That was the beginning of aqueer friendship which lasted a week, and endedas I will tell you!She was exactly like a child. She wanted to be with me always. Shetried to follow me everywhere, and on my next journey out and about itwent to my heart to tire her down, and leave her at last, exhausted andcalling after me rather plaintively. But the problems of the world hadto be mastered. I had not, I said to myself, come into the future tocarry on a miniature flirtation. Yet her distress when I left her wasvery great, her expostulations at the parting were sometimes frantic,and I think, altogether, I had as much trouble as comfort from herdevotion. Nevertheless she was, somehow, a very great comfort. Ithought it was mere childish affection that made her cling to me. Untilit was too late, I did not clearly know what I had inflicted upon herwhen I left her. Nor until it was too late did I clearly understandwhat she was to me. For, by merely seeming fond of me, and showing inher weak, futile way that she cared for me, the little doll of acreature presently gave my return to the neighbourhood of the WhiteSphinx almost the feeling of coming home; and I would watch for hertiny figure of white and gold so soon as I came over the hill.It was from her, too, that I learnt that fear had not yet left theworld. She was fearless enough in the daylight, and she had the oddestconfidence in me; for once, in a foolish moment, I made threateninggrimaces at her, and she simply laughed at them. But she dreaded thedark, dreaded shadows, dreaded black things. Darkness to her was theone thing dreadful. It was a singularly passionate emotion, and it setme thinking and observing. I discovered then, among other things, thatthese little people gathered into the great houses after dark, andslept in droves. To enter upon them without a light was to put theminto a tumult of apprehension. I never found one out of doors, or onesleeping alone within doors, after dark. Yet I was still such ablockhead that I missed the lesson of that fear, and in spite ofWeenas distress, I insisted upon sleeping away from these slumberingmultitudes.It troubled her greatly, but in the end her odd affection for metriumphed, and for five of the nights of our acquaintance, includingthe last night of all, she slept with her head pillowed on my arm. Butmy story slips away from me as I speak of her. It must have been thenight before her rescue that I was awakened about dawn. I had beenrestless, dreaming most disagreeably that I was drowned, and that seaanemones were feeling over my face with their soft palps. I woke with astart, and with an odd fancy that some greyish animal had just rushedout of the chamber. I tried to get to sleep again, but I felt restlessand uncomfortable. It was that dim grey hour when things are justcreeping out of darkness, when everything is colourless and clear cut,and yet unreal. I got up, and went down into the great hall, and so outupon the flagstones in front of the palace. I thought I would make avirtue of necessity, and see the sunrise.The moon was setting, and the dying moonlight and the first pallor ofdawn were mingled in a ghastly half-light. The bushes were inky black,the ground a sombre grey, the sky colourless and cheerless. And up thehill I thought I could see ghosts. Three several times, as I scannedthe slope, I saw white figures. Twice I fancied I saw a solitary white,ape-like creature running rather quickly up the hill, and once near theruins I saw a leash of them carrying some dark body. They movedhastily. I did not see what became of them. It seemed that theyvanished among the bushes. The dawn was still indistinct, you mustunderstand. I was feeling that chill, uncertain, early-morning feelingyou may have known. I doubted my eyes.As the eastern sky grew brighter, and the light of the day came on andits vivid colouring returned upon the world once more, I scanned theview keenly. But I saw no vestige of my white figures. They were merecreatures of the half-light. They must have been ghosts, I said; Iwonder whence they dated. For a queer notion of Grant Allens cameinto my head, and amused me. If each generation die and leave ghosts,he argued, the world at last will get overcrowded with them. On thattheory they would have grown innumerable some Eight Hundred ThousandYears hence, and it was no great wonder to see four at once. But thejest was unsatisfying, and I was thinking of these figures all themorning, until Weenas rescue drove them out of my head. I associatedthem in some indefinite way with the white animal I had startled in myfirst passionate search for the Time Machine. But Weena was a pleasantsubstitute. Yet all the same, they were soon destined to take fardeadlier possession of my mind.I think I have said how much hotter than our own was the weather ofthis Golden Age. I cannot account for it. It may be that the sun washotter, or the earth nearer the sun. It is usual to assume that the sunwill go on cooling steadily in the future. But people, unfamiliar withsuch speculations as those of the younger Darwin, forget that theplanets must ultimately fall back one by one into the parent body. Asthese catastrophes occur, the sun will blaze with renewed energy; andit may be that some inner planet had suffered this fate. Whatever thereason, the fact remains that the sun was very much hotter than we knowit.Well, one very hot morningmy fourth, I thinkas I was seeking shelterfrom the heat and glare in a colossal ruin near the great house where Islept and fed, there happened this strange thing. Clambering amongthese heaps of masonry, I found a narrow gallery, whose end and sidewindows were blocked by fallen masses of stone. By contrast with thebrilliancy outside, it seemed at first impenetrably dark to me. Ientered it groping, for the change from light to blackness made spotsof colour swim before me. Suddenly I halted spellbound. A pair of eyes,luminous by reflection against the daylight without, was watching meout of the darkness.The old instinctive dread of wild beasts came upon me. I clenched myhands and steadfastly looked into the glaring eyeballs. I was afraid toturn. Then the thought of the absolute security in which humanityappeared to be living came to my mind. And then I remembered thatstrange terror of the dark. Overcoming my fear to some extent, Iadvanced a step and spoke. I will admit that my voice was harsh andill-controlled. I put out my hand and touched something soft. At oncethe eyes darted sideways, and something white ran past me. I turnedwith my heart in my mouth, and saw a queer little ape-like figure, itshead held down in a peculiar manner, running across the sunlit spacebehind me. It blundered against a block of granite, staggered aside,and in a moment was hidden in a black shadow beneath another pile ofruined masonry.My impression of it is, of course, imperfect; but I know it was a dullwhite, and had strange large greyish-red eyes; also that there wasflaxen hair on its head and down its back. But, as I say, it went toofast for me to see distinctly. I cannot even say whether it ran on allfours, or only with its forearms held very low. After an instantspause I followed it into the second heap of ruins. I could not find itat first; but, after a time in the profound obscurity, I came upon oneof those round well-like openings of which I have told you, half closedby a fallen pillar. A sudden thought came to me. Could this Thing havevanished down the shaft? I lit a match, and, looking down, I saw asmall, white, moving creature, with large bright eyes which regarded mesteadfastly as it retreated. It made me shudder. It was so like a humanspider! It was clambering down the wall, and now I saw for the firsttime a number of metal foot and hand rests forming a kind of ladderdown the shaft. Then the light burned my fingers and fell out of myhand, going out as it dropped, and when I had lit another the littlemonster had disappeared.I do not know how long I sat peering down that well. It was not forsome time that I could succeed in persuading myself that the thing Ihad seen was human. But, gradually, the truth dawned on me: that Manhad not remained one species, but had differentiated into two distinctanimals: that my graceful children of the Upper World were not the soledescendants of our generation, but that this bleached, obscene,nocturnal Thing, which had flashed before me, was also heir to all theages.I thought of the flickering pillars and of my theory of an undergroundventilation. I began to suspect their true import. And what, Iwondered, was this Lemur doing in my scheme of a perfectly balancedorganisation? How was it related to the indolent serenity of thebeautiful Overworlders? And what was hidden down there, at the foot ofthat shaft? I sat upon the edge of the well telling myself that, at anyrate, there was nothing to fear, and that there I must descend for thesolution of my difficulties. And withal I was absolutely afraid to go!As I hesitated, two of the beautiful upperworld people came running intheir amorous sport across the daylight in the shadow. The male pursuedthe female, flinging flowers at her as he ran.They seemed distressed to find me, my arm against the overturnedpillar, peering down the well. Apparently it was considered bad form toremark these apertures; for when I pointed to this one, and tried toframe a question about it in their tongue, they were still more visiblydistressed and turned away. But they were interested by my matches, andI struck some to amuse them. I tried them again about the well, andagain I failed. So presently I left them, meaning to go back to Weena,and see what I could get from her. But my mind was already inrevolution; my guesses and impressions were slipping and sliding to anew adjustment. I had now a clue to the import of these wells, to theventilating towers, to the mystery of the ghosts; to say nothing of ahint at the meaning of the bronze gates and the fate of the TimeMachine! And very vaguely there came a suggestion towards the solutionof the economic problem that had puzzled me.Here was the new view. Plainly, this second species of Man wassubterranean. There were three circumstances in particular which mademe think that its rare emergence above ground was the outcome of along-continued underground habit. In the first place, there was thebleached look common in most animals that live largely in the darkthewhite fish of the Kentucky caves, for instance. Then, those large eyes,with that capacity for reflecting light, are common features ofnocturnal thingswitness the owl and the cat. And last of all, thatevident confusion in the sunshine, that hasty yet fumbling awkwardflight towards dark shadow, and that peculiar carriage of the headwhile in the lightall reinforced the theory of an extremesensitiveness of the retina.Beneath my feet, then, the earth must be tunnelled enormously, andthese tunnellings were the habitat of the New Race. The presence ofventilating shafts and wells along the hill slopeseverywhere, in fact,except along the river valleyshowed how universal were itsramifications. What so natural, then, as to assume that it was in thisartificial Underworld that such work as was necessary to the comfort ofthe daylight race was done? The notion was so plausible that I at onceaccepted it, and went on to assume the how of this splitting of thehuman species. I dare say you will anticipate the shape of my theory;though, for myself, I very soon felt that it fell far short of thetruth.At first, proceeding from the problems of our own age, it seemed clearas daylight to me that the gradual widening of the present merelytemporary and social difference between the Capitalist and the Labourerwas the key to the whole position. No doubt it will seem grotesqueenough to youand wildly incredible!and yet even now there areexisting circumstances to point that way. There is a tendency toutilise underground space for the less ornamental purposes ofcivilisation; there is the Metropolitan Railway in London, forinstance, there are new electric railways, there are subways, there areunderground workrooms and restaurants, and they increase and multiply.Evidently, I thought, this tendency had increased till Industry hadgradually lost its birthright in the sky. I mean that it had gonedeeper and deeper into larger and ever larger underground factories,spending a still-increasing amount of its time therein, till, in theend! Even now, does not an East-end worker live in such artificialconditions as practically to be cut off from the natural surface of theearth?Again, the exclusive tendency of richer peopledue, no doubt, to theincreasing refinement of their education, and the widening gulf betweenthem and the rude violence of the pooris already leading to theclosing, in their interest, of considerable portions of the surface ofthe land. About London, for instance, perhaps half the prettier countryis shut in against intrusion. And this same widening gulfwhich is dueto the length and expense of the higher educational process and theincreased facilities for and temptations towards refined habits on thepart of the richwill make that exchange between class and class, thatpromotion by intermarriage which at present retards the splitting ofour species along lines of social stratification, less and lessfrequent. So, in the end, above ground you must have the Haves,pursuing pleasure and comfort and beauty, and below ground theHave-nots, the Workers getting continually adapted to the conditions oftheir labour. Once they were there, they would no doubt have to payrent, and not a little of it, for the ventilation of their caverns; andif they refused, they would starve or be suffocated for arrears. Suchof them as were so constituted as to be miserable and rebellious woulddie; and, in the end, the balance being permanent, the survivors wouldbecome as well adapted to the conditions of underground life, and ashappy in their way, as the Overworld people were to theirs. As itseemed to me, the refined beauty and the etiolated pallor followednaturally enough.The great triumph of Humanity I had dreamed of took a different shapein my mind. It had been no such triumph of moral education and generalco-operation as I had imagined. Instead, I saw a real aristocracy,armed with a perfected science and working to a logical conclusion theindustrial system of today. Its triumph had not been simply a triumphover Nature, but a triumph over Nature and the fellow-man. This, I mustwarn you, was my theory at the time. I had no convenient cicerone inthe pattern of the Utopian books. My explanation may be absolutelywrong. I still think it is the most plausible one. But even on thissupposition the balanced civilisation that was at last attained musthave long since passed its zenith, and was now far fallen into decay.The too-perfect security of the Overworlders had led them to a slowmovement of degeneration, to a general dwindling in size, strength, andintelligence. That I could see clearly enough already. What hadhappened to the Undergrounders I did not yet suspect; but, from what Ihad seen of the Morlocksthat, by the bye, was the name by which thesecreatures were calledI could imagine that the modification of thehuman type was even far more profound than among the Eloi, thebeautiful race that I already knew.Then came troublesome doubts. Why had the Morlocks taken my TimeMachine? For I felt sure it was they who had taken it. Why, too, if theEloi were masters, could they not restore the machine to me? And whywere they so terribly afraid of the dark? I proceeded, as I have said,to question Weena about this Underworld, but here again I wasdisappointed. At first she would not understand my questions, andpresently she refused to answer them. She shivered as though the topicwas unendurable. And when I pressed her, perhaps a little harshly, sheburst into tears. They were the only tears, except my own, I ever sawin that Golden Age. When I saw them I ceased abruptly to trouble aboutthe Morlocks, and was only concerned in banishing these signs of herhuman inheritance from Weenas eyes. And very soon she was smiling andclapping her hands, while I solemnly burnt a match. IX. The MorlocksIt may seem odd to you, but it was two days before I could follow upthe new-found clue in what was manifestly the proper way. I felt apeculiar shrinking from those pallid bodies. They were just thehalf-bleached colour of the worms and things one sees preserved inspirit in a zoological museum. And they were filthily cold to thetouch. Probably my shrinking was largely due to the sympatheticinfluence of the Eloi, whose disgust of the Morlocks I now began toappreciate.The next night I did not sleep well. Probably my health was a littledisordered. I was oppressed with perplexity and doubt. Once or twice Ihad a feeling of intense fear for which I could perceive no definitereason. I remember creeping noiselessly into the great hall where thelittle people were sleeping in the moonlightthat night Weena was amongthemand feeling reassured by their presence. It occurred to me eventhen, that in the course of a few days the moon must pass through itslast quarter, and the nights grow dark, when the appearances of theseunpleasant creatures from below, these whitened Lemurs, this new verminthat had replaced the old, might be more abundant. And on both thesedays I had the restless feeling of one who shirks an inevitable duty. Ifelt assured that the Time Machine was only to be recovered by boldlypenetrating these mysteries of underground. Yet I could not face themystery. If only I had had a companion it would have been different.But I was so horribly alone, and even to clamber down into the darknessof the well appalled me. I dont know if you will understand myfeeling, but I never felt quite safe at my back.It was this restlessness, this insecurity, perhaps, that drove mefarther and farther afield in my exploring expeditions. Going to thesouth-westward towards the rising country that is now called CombeWood, I observed far-off, in the direction of nineteenth-centuryBanstead, a vast green structure, different in character from any I hadhitherto seen.

But theday was growing late, and I had come upon the sight of the place aftera long and tiring circuit; so I resolved to hold over the adventure forthe following day, and I returned to the welcome and the caresses oflittle Weena. But next morning I perceived clearly enough that mycuriosity regarding the Palace of Green Porcelain was a piece ofself-deception, to enable me to shirk, by another day, an experience Idreaded. I resolved I would make the descent without further waste oftime, and started out in the early morning towards a well near theruins of granite and aluminium.Little Weena ran with me. She danced beside me to the well, but whenshe saw me lean over the mouth and look downward, she seemed strangelydisconcerted. Good-bye, little Weena, I said, kissing her; and thenputting her down, I began to feel over the parapet for the climbinghooks.
